<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Since</span> 1870-1, when J. E. Austen Leigh<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> published his
<i>Memoir of Jane Austen</i>, considerable additions have
been made to the stock of information available for
her biographers. Of these fresh sources of knowledge
the set of letters from Jane to Cassandra, edited by
Lord Brabourne, has been by far the most important.
These letters are invaluable as <i>m&eacute;moires pour servir;</i>
although they cover only the comparatively rare
periods when the two sisters were separated, and
although Cassandra purposely destroyed many of
the letters likely to prove the most interesting, from
a distaste for publicity.</div>

<p>Some further correspondence, and many incidents
in the careers of two of her brothers, may be read in
<i>Jane Austen's Sailor Brothers</i>, by J. H. Hubback
and Edith C. Hubback; while Miss Constance Hill
has been able to add several family traditions to the
interesting topographical information embodied in
her <i>Jane Austen: Her Homes and Her Friends</i>. Nor
ought we to forget the careful research shown in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
other biographies of the author, especially that by
Mr. Oscar Fay Adams.</p>

<p>During the last few years, we have been fortunate
enough to be able to add to this store; and every
existing MS. or tradition preserved by the family,
of which we have any knowledge, has been placed
at our disposal.</p>

<p>It seemed, therefore, to us that the time had come
when a more complete chronological account of the
novelist's life might be laid before the public, whose
interest in Jane Austen (as we readily acknowledge)
has shown no signs of diminishing, either in
England or in America.</p>

<p>The <i>Memoir</i> must always remain the one firsthand
account of her, resting on the authority of a
nephew who knew her intimately and that of his
two sisters. We could not compete with its vivid
personal recollections; and the last thing we should
wish to do, even were it possible, would be to supersede
it. We believe, however, that it needs to be
supplemented, not only because so much additional
material has been brought to light since its publication,
but also because the account given of their
aunt by her nephew and nieces could be given only
from their own point of view, while the incidents
and characters fall into a somewhat different
perspective if the whole is seen from a greater
distance. Their knowledge of their aunt was during
the last portion of her life, and they knew her best
of all in her last year, when her health was failing
and she was living in much seclusion; and they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
were not likely to be the recipients of her inmost
confidences on the events and sentiments of her youth.</p>

<p>Hence the emotional and romantic side of her
nature&mdash;a very real one&mdash;has not been dwelt upon.
No doubt the Austens were, as a family, unwilling to
show their deeper feelings, and the sad end of Jane's
one romance would naturally tend to intensify this
dislike of expression; but the feeling was there, and
it finally found utterance in her latest work, when,
through Anne Elliot, she claimed for women the
right of 'loving longest when existence or when
hope is gone.'</p>

<p>Then, again, her nephew and nieces hardly knew
how much she had gone into society, or how much,
with a certain characteristic aloofness, she had enjoyed
it. Bath, either when she was the guest of her
uncle and aunt or when she was a resident; London,
with her brother Henry and his wife, and the rather
miscellaneous society which they enjoyed; Godmersham,
with her brother Edward and his county
neighbours in East Kent;&mdash;these had all given her
many opportunities of studying the particular types
which she blended into her own creations.</p>

<p>A third point is the uneventful nature of the
author's life, which, as we think, has been a good deal
exaggerated. Quiet it certainly was; but the quiet
life of a member of a large family in the England
of that date was compatible with a good deal of
stirring incident, happening, if not to herself, at all
events to those who were nearest to her, and who
commanded her deepest sympathies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>

<p>We hope therefore that our narrative, with all
its imperfections and its inevitable repetition of
much that has already been published, will at least
be of use in removing misconceptions, in laying some
new facts before the reader, and in placing others in
a fresh light. It is intended as a narrative, and not
as a piece of literary criticism; for we should not
care to embark upon the latter in competition with
biographers and essayists who have a better claim
to be heard.</p>

<p>Both in the plan and in the execution of our
work we have received much valuable help from
another member of the family, Mary A. Austen
Leigh.[2]</p>

<p>An arrangement courteously made by the
owners of the copyright has procured for us a free
and ample use of the Letters as edited by Lord
Brabourne<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>; while the kindness of Mr. J. G.
Nicholson of Castlefield House, Sturton-by-Scawby,
Lincolnshire, has opened a completely new source
of information in the letters which passed between
the Austens and their kinsmen of the half-blood&mdash;Walters
of Kent and afterwards of Lincolnshire.
Miss Jane Austen, granddaughter of Admiral Charles
Austen, and Miss Margaret Bellas, great-granddaughter
of James Austen, are so good as to allow
us to make a fuller use of their family documents
than was found possible by the author of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
<i>Memoir;</i> while Mr. J. H. Hubback permits us to
draw freely upon the <i>Sailor Brothers</i>, and Captain
E. L. Austen, R.N., upon his MSS. Finally, we
owe to Admiral Ernest Rice kind permission
to have the photograph taken, from which the
reproduction of his Zoffany portrait is made into
a frontispiece for this volume. We hope that any
other friends who have helped us will accept this
general expression of our gratitude.</p>

<h2>JANE AUSTEN</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>AUSTENS AND LEIGHS</h3>

<h3>1600-1764</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>At</span> the end of the sixteenth century there was living
at Horsmonden&mdash;a small village in the Weald of
Kent&mdash;a certain John Austen. From his will it is
evident that he was a man of considerable means,
owning property in Kent and Sussex and elsewhere;
he also held a lease of certain lands from Sir
Henry Whetenhall, including in all probability the
manor house of Broadford in Horsmonden. What
wealth he had was doubtless derived from the clothing
trade; for Hasted<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> instances the Austens, together
with the Bathursts, Courthopes, and others, as some
of the ancient families of that part 'now of large
estate and genteel rank in life,' but sprung from
ancestors who had used the great staple manufacture
of clothing. He adds that these clothiers 'were
usually called the Gray Coats of Kent, and were a
body so numerous that at County Elections whoever
had their vote and interest was almost certain of
being elected.'</div>

<p>John Austen died in 1620, leaving a large family.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Of these, the fifth son, Francis, who died in 1687,
describes himself in his will as a clothier, of Grovehurst;
this place being, like Broadford, a pretty
timbered house of moderate size near the picturesque
old village of Horsmonden. Both houses still belong
to the Austen family. Francis left a son, John, whose
son was another John. This last John settled at
Broadford (while his father remained at Grovehurst),
and, when quite young, married Elizabeth Weller.
He seems to have been a careless, easy-going man,
who thought frugality unnecessary, as he would succeed
to the estate on his father's death; but he died
of consumption in 1704, a year before that event took
place. One of his sisters married into the family of
the Stringers (neighbours engaged in the same trade
as the Austens), and numbered among her descendants
the Knights of Godmersham&mdash;a circumstance which
exercised an important influence over the subsequent
fortunes of the Austen family.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Weller, a woman happily cast in a
different mould from her husband, was an ancestress
of Jane Austen who deserves commemoration.
Thrifty, energetic, a careful mother, and a prudent
housewife, she managed, though receiving only
grudging assistance from the Austen family, to pay
off her husband's debts, and to give to all her younger
children a decent education at a school at Sevenoaks;
the eldest boy (the future squire) being taken off her
hands by his grandfather.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Elizabeth left behind her
not only elaborately kept accounts but also a minute
description of her actions through many years and of
the motives which governed them. It may be interest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>ing
to quote one sentence relating to her move from
Horsmonden to Sevenoaks for the sake of her children's
education. 'These considerations with y<sup>e</sup> tho'ts
of having my own boys in y<sup>e</sup> house, with a good master
(as all represented him to be) were y<sup>e</sup> inducements
that brought me to Sen'nock, for it seemed to me as
if I cou'd not do a better thing for my children's
good, their education being my great care, and indeed
all I think I was capable of doing for 'em, for I always
tho't if they had learning, they might get better shift
in y<sup>e</sup> world, with w<sup>t</sup> small fortune was alloted 'em.'</p>

<p>When the good mother died in 1721, her work was
done. Schooldays were over, the daughter married,
and the boys already making their way in the world.</p>

<p>The young squire and his son held gentle sway
at Broadford through the eighteenth century; but
much more stirring and able was the next brother,
Francis. He became a solicitor. Setting up at
Sevenoaks 'with eight hundred pounds and a bundle
of pens,' he contrived to amass a very large fortune,
living most hospitably, and yet buying up all the
valuable land round the town which he could secure,
and enlarging his means by marrying two wealthy
wives. But his first marriage did not take place till
he was nearer fifty than forty; and he had as a
bachelor been a most generous benefactor to the sons
of his two next brothers, Thomas and William.</p>

<p>His second wife, who became in due course of
time godmother to her great-niece, Jane Austen, was
the widow of Samuel Lennard, of West Wickham,
who left her his estate. Legal proceedings ensued
over the will, and Mrs. Lennard took counsel of
Francis Austen, who ended by winning both the case
and her hand. Francis's son by his first wife (known
as Motley Austen) rounded off the family estate at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Sevenoaks by purchasing the Kippington property.
Motley's third son, John, eventually inherited the
Broadford estate. Francis's two most distinguished
descendants were Colonel Thomas Austen of Kippington,
well known as M.P. for Kent, and the Rev.
John Thomas Austen, senior wrangler in 1817.</p>

<p>Both the two next brothers of Francis Austen
adopted the medical profession. Thomas, an apothecary
at Tonbridge, had an only son, Henry, who graduated
at Cambridge, and, through his uncle's interest,
held the living of West Wickham for twenty years. His
descendants on the female side are still flourishing.</p>

<p>William, the surgeon, Jane Austen's grandfather,
is more immediately interesting to us. He married
Rebecca, daughter of Sir George Hampson, a
physician of Gloucester, and widow of another
medical man, James Walter. By her first husband
she had a son, William Hampson Walter, born in
1721; by her second she had three daughters, and
one son, George, born in 1731. Philadelphia&mdash;the
only daughter who grew up and married&mdash;we shall
meet with later. Rebecca Austen died in 1733, and
three years later William married Susanna Holk, of
whom nothing is known except that she died at an
advanced age, and did not mention any of the Austens
in her will; neither is there any trace of her in any
of the family records with which we are acquainted;
so it is hardly probable that little George Austen
(Jane's father), who had lost both his parents when
he was six years old, continued under the care of his
stepmother. However, all that we know of his
childhood is that his uncle Francis befriended him,
and sent him to Tonbridge School, and that from
Tonbridge he obtained a Scholarship (and subsequently
a Fellowship) at St. John's College, Oxford<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>&mdash;the
College at which, later on, through George's own
marriage, his descendants were to be 'founder's kin.'
He returned to teach at his old school, occupying
the post of second master there in 1758, and in the
next year he was again in residence at Oxford, where
his good looks gained for him the name of 'the
handsome proctor.' In 1760 he took Orders, and in
1761 was presented by Mr. Knight of Godmersham&mdash;who
had married a descendant of his great-aunt,
Jane Stringer&mdash;to the living of Steventon, near
Overton in Hampshire. It was a time of laxity in
the Church, and George Austen (though he afterwards
became an excellent parish-priest) does not
seem to have resided or done duty at Steventon
before the year 1764, when his marriage to Cassandra
Leigh must have made the rectory appear a desirable
home to which to bring his bride.</p>

<p>Before we say anything of the Leighs, a few
sentences must be devoted to George Austen's relations
of the half-blood&mdash;the Walters. With his
mother's son by her first husband, William Hampson
Walter, he remained on intimate terms. A good
many letters are extant which passed between the
Austens and the Walters during the early married life
of the former, the last of them containing the news
of the birth of Jane. Besides this, William Walter's
daughter, 'Phila,' was a constant correspondent of
George Austen's niece Eliza.</p>

<p>The Walter family settled in Lincolnshire, where
they have held Church preferment, and have also
been well known in the world of sport. Phila's
brother James seems to have been at the same time
an exemplary parson, beloved by his flock, and also
a sort of 'Jack Russell,' and is said to have met his
death in the hunting-field, by falling into a snow-drift,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
at the age of eighty-four. His son Henry distinguished
himself in a more academical manner.
He was second wrangler in 1806, and a Fellow of
St. John's. Nor was he only a mathematician; for
in June 1813 Jane Austen met a young man named
Wilkes, an undergraduate of St. John's, who spoke
very highly of Walter as a scholar; he said he was
considered the best classic at Cambridge. She adds:
'How such a report would have interested my father!'
Henry Walter was at one time tutor at Haileybury,
and was also a beneficed clergyman. He was known
at Court; indeed, it is said that, while he declined
higher preferment for himself, he was consulted by
George IV and William IV on the selection of
bishops.</p>

<p>The wife that George Austen chose belonged to
the somewhat large clan of the Leighs of Adlestrop in
Gloucestershire, of which family the Leighs<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> of Stoneleigh
were a younger branch. Her father was the Rev.
Thomas Leigh, elected Fellow of All Souls at so early
an age that he was ever after called 'Chick Leigh,'
and afterwards Rector of Harpsden, near Henley.</p>

<p>Both these branches of the Leigh family descended
from Sir Thomas Leigh, Lord Mayor of London,
behind whom Queen Elizabeth rode to be proclaimed
at Paul's Cross. He was rich enough and great
enough to endow more than one son with estates;
but while the elder line at Adlestrop remained simple
squires, the younger at Stoneleigh rose to a peerage.
The latter branch, however, were now rapidly
approaching extinction, while the former had many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
vigorous scions. The family records have much to
say of one of the squires&mdash;Theophilus (who died in
1724), the husband of Mary Brydges and the father of
twelve children, a strong character, and one who lived
up to fixed, if rather narrow, ideas of duty. We hear
of his old-fashioned dress and elaborate bows and
postures, of his affability to his neighbours, and his
just, though somewhat strict, government of his sons.
It is difficult to picture to oneself a set of modern
Oxford men standing patiently after dinner, in the
dining-parlour, as Theophilus's sons did, 'till desired
to sit down and drink Church and King.' Meanwhile,
his brother-in-law, the Duke of Chandos (the
patron of Handel), used to send for the daughters to
be educated in the splendour of Canons (his place in
Middlesex), and to make such matches as he chose
for them with dowries of &pound;3000 a-piece.</p>

<p>Cassandra's father, Thomas, was the fourth son
of Theophilus Leigh. An older and better known
brother was another Theophilus, Master of Balliol
for more than half a century.</p>

<p>The story of his election, in 1727, is remarkable.
The Fellows of Balliol could not agree in the choice of
any one of their own body; and one set, thinking it
would be no disadvantage to have a duke's brother
as master, invited their visitor, Dr. Brydges<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>, to stand.
On his declining, they brought forward his nephew,
Theophilus Leigh, then a young Fellow of Corpus.
The election resulted in a tie, and the visitor had no
qualms of conscience in giving his casting vote to
his nephew. Theophilus proved to be a man 'more<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
famous for his sayings than his doings, overflowing
with puns and witticisms and sharp retorts; but his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
most serious joke was his practical one of living
much longer than had been expected or intended.'
He no doubt became a most dignified Head, and
inspired the young men with fear and respect; but
he must have sometimes remembered the awful day
when he first preached before his father, who immediately
turned his back on the divine, saying afterwards:
'I thank you, Theo, for your discourse; let
us hereafter have less rhetoric and more divinity;
I turned my back lest my presence might daunt you.'
When Theo in turn was an old man, and when Jane
Austen's eldest brother went to Oxford, he was
asked to dine with this dignified kinsman. Being a raw
freshman, he was about to take off his gown, when
the old man of eighty said with a grim smile: 'Young
man, you need not strip; we are not going to fight.'<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Cassandra Leigh's youth was spent in the quiet
rectory of Harpsden, for her father was one of the
more conscientious of the gently born clergy of that
day, living entirely on his benefice, and greatly
beloved in his neighbourhood as an exemplary parish-priest.
'He was one of the most contented, quiet,
sweet-tempered, generous, cheerful men I ever knew,'
so says the chronicler of the Leigh family, 'and his
wife was his counterpart. The spirit of the pugnacious
Theophilus dwelt not in him; nor that eternal
love of company which distinguished the other
brothers, yet he was by no means unsocial.' Towards
the end of his life he removed to Bath, being severely
afflicted with the gout, and here he died in 1763. His
peaceful wife, Jane Walker, was descended on her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
mother's side from a sufficiently warlike family; she
was the daughter of an Oxford physician, who had
married a Miss Perrot, one of the last of a very old
stock, long settled in Oxfordshire, but also known in
Pembrokeshire at least as early as the fourteenth
century. They were probably among the settlers
planted there to overawe the Welsh, and it is recorded
of one of them that he slew 'twenty-six men of Kemaes
and one wolf.' A contrast to these uncompromising
ancestors was found in Mrs. Leigh's aunt, Ann
Perrot, one of the family circle at Harpsden, whom
tradition states to have been a very pious, good
woman. Unselfish she certainly was, for she earnestly
begged her brother, Mr. Thomas Perrot, to alter his
will by which he had bequeathed to her his estates
at Northleigh in Oxfordshire, and to leave her instead
an annuity of one hundred pounds. Her brother
complied with her request, and by a codicil devised
the estates to his great-nephew, James, son of the
Rev. Thomas Leigh, on condition that he took
the surname and arms of Perrot.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Accordingly,
on the death of Mr. Thomas Perrot at the beginning
of 1751, James Leigh became James Leigh Perrot
of Northleigh. His two sisters, Jane and Cassandra,
also profited by the kindness of their great-aunt, who
left two hundred pounds to each. Another legacy
which filtered through the Walkers from the Perrots
to the Austens was the advantage of being 'kin'
to the Founder of St. John's College, Oxford&mdash;Sir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Thomas White&mdash;an advantage of which several
members of the family availed themselves.</p>

<p>Northleigh, for some reason or other, did not suit
its new owner. He pulled down the mansion and
sold the estate to the Duke of Marlborough, buying
for himself a property at Hare Hatch on the Bath
Road, midway between Maidenhead and Reading.
We shall meet him again, and his devoted wife, Jane
Cholmeley; and we shall see a remarkable instance
of his steadfast love for her.</p>

<p>George Austen perhaps met his future wife at
the house of her uncle, the Master of Balliol, but no
particulars of the courtship have survived. The
marriage took place at Walcot Church, Bath, on
April 26, 1764, the bride's father having died at Bath
only a short time before. Two circumstances connected
with their brief honeymoon&mdash;which consisted
only of a journey from Bath to Steventon, broken
by one day's halt at Andover&mdash;may be mentioned.
The bride's 'going-away' dress seems to have been a
scarlet riding-habit, whose future adventures were not
uninteresting; and the pair are believed to have had
an unusual companion for such an occasion&mdash;namely,
a small boy, six years old, the only son of Warren
Hastings by his first wife. We are told that he was
committed to the charge of Mr. Austen when he was
sent over to England in 1761, and we shall see later
that there was a reason for this connexion; but a
three-year-old boy is a curious charge for a bachelor,
and poor little George must have wanted a nurse
rather than a tutor. In any case, he came under Mrs.
Austen's maternal care, who afterwards mourned for
his early death 'as if he had been a child of her own.'<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>STEVENTON</h3>

<h3>1764-1785</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>Steventon</span> is a small village tucked away among
the Hampshire Downs, about seven miles south of
Basingstoke. It is now looked down upon at close
quarters by the South-Western Railway, but, at the
time of which we are writing, it was almost equidistant
from two main roads: one running from
Basingstoke to Andover, which would be joined at
Deane Gate, the other from Basingstoke to Winchester,
joined at Popham Lane. Communication
with London was maintained&mdash;at any rate, in 1800&mdash;by
two coaches that ran each night through Deane
Gate. It does not appear, however, to have been
by any means certain that an unexpected traveller
would get a place in either of them.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></div>

<p>The surrounding country is certainly not picturesque;
it presents no grand or extensive views:
the features, however, being small rather than plain.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
It is, in fact, an undulating district whose hills have
no marked character, and the poverty of whose soil
prevents the timber from attaining a great size.
We need not therefore be surprised to hear that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
when Cassandra Leigh saw the place for the first
time, just before her marriage, she should think it
very inferior to the valley of the Thames at Henley.
Yet the neighbourhood had its beauties of rustic
lanes and hidden nooks; and Steventon, from the
fall of the ground and the abundance of its timber,
was one of the prettiest spots in it. The Rectory had
been of the most miserable description, but George
Austen improved it until it became a tolerably
roomy and convenient habitation. It stood 'in a
shallow valley, surrounded by sloping meadows, well
sprinkled with elm-trees, at the end of a small village
of cottages, each well provided with a garden, scattered
about prettily on either side of the road.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. North
of the house, the road from Deane to Popham Lane
ran at a sufficient distance from the front to allow
a carriage drive, through turf and trees. On the
south side, the ground rose gently and was occupied
by one of those old-fashioned<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> gardens in which
vegetables and flowers are combined, flanked and
protected on the east by one of the thatched mud
walls common in that country, and overshadowed
by fine elms. Along the upper or southern side of
the garden ran a terrace of the finest turf, which must
have been in the writer's thoughts when she described
Catherine Morland's childish delight in "rolling down
the green slope at the back of the house."</p>

<p>'But the chief beauty of Steventon consisted in
its hedgerows. A hedgerow in that country does
not mean a thin formal line of quickset, but an
irregular border of copse-wood and timber, often
wide enough to contain within it a winding footpath,
or a rough cart-track. Under its shelter the earliest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
primroses, anemones, and wild hyacinths were to be
found; sometimes the first bird's nest; and, now
and then, the unwelcome adder. Two such hedgerows
radiated, as it were, from the parsonage garden.
One, a continuation of the turf terrace, proceeded
westward, forming the southern boundary of the
home meadows; and was formed into a rustic
shrubbery, with occasional seats, entitled "The
Wood Walk." The other ran straight up the hill,
under the name of "The Church Walk," because it
led to the parish church, as well as to a fine old
manor-house of Henry VIII's time, occupied by
a family named Digweed, who for more than a
century rented it, together with the chief farm in
the parish.'</p>

<p>The usefulness of a hedgerow as a place where a
heroine might remain unseen and overhear what was
not intended to reach her ears must have impressed
itself early on the mind of our author; and readers
of <i>Persuasion</i> will remember the scene in the
fields near Uppercross where Anne hears a conversation
about herself carried on by Captain Wentworth
and Louisa Musgrove. The writer had possibly
intended to introduce a similar scene into <i>Mansfield
Park</i>, for, in a letter to her sister, of January 29, 1813,
when turning from <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> to a new
subject, she says: 'If you could discover whether
Northamptonshire is a country of hedgerows I should
be glad again.' Presumably, her question was
answered in the negative, and her scrupulous desire
for accuracy did not allow of her making use of the
intended device.</p>

<p>Steventon Church 'might have appeared mean
and uninteresting to an ordinary observer; but
the adept in church architecture would have known<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
that it must have stood there some seven centuries,
and would have found beauty in the very narrow
Early English windows, as well as in the general
proportions of its little chancel; while its solitary
position, far from the hum of the village, and within
sight of no habitation, except a glimpse of the grey
manor-house through its circling green of sycamores,
has in it something solemn and appropriate to the
last resting-place of the silent dead. Sweet violets,
both purple and white, grow in abundance beneath
its south wall. One may imagine for how many
centuries the ancestors of those little flowers have
occupied that undisturbed sunny nook, and may
think how few living families can boast of as ancient
a tenure of their land. Large elms protrude their
rough branches; old hawthorns shed their annual
blossoms over the graves; and the hollow yew-tree
must be at least coeval with the church. But whatever
may be the beauties or defects of the surrounding
scenery, this was the residence of Jane Austen for
twenty-four years. This was the cradle of her genius.
These were the first objects which inspired her young
heart with a sense of the beauties of nature. In
strolls along these wood-walks, thick-coming fancies
rose to her mind, and gradually assumed the forms
in which they came forth to the world. In that
simple church she brought them all into subjection
to the piety which ruled her in life and supported
her in death.'</p>

<p>To this description of the surroundings of the
home, given by the author of the <i>Memoir</i>, whose
own home it was through childhood and boyhood,
we may add a few sentences respecting its interior
as it appeared to his sister, Mrs. Lefroy. She speaks
of her grandfather's study looking cheerfully into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the sunny garden, 'his own exclusive property, safe
from the bustle of all household cares,' and adds:</p>

<p>'The dining- or common sitting-room looked to the
front and was lighted by two casement windows.
On the same side the front door opened into a smaller
parlour, and visitors, who were few and rare, were
not a bit the less welcome to my grandmother because
they found her sitting there busily engaged with
her needle,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> making and mending. In later times&mdash;but
not probably until my two aunts had completed
their short course at Mrs. Latournelle's at
Reading Abbey, and were living at home&mdash;a sitting-room
was made upstairs: "the dressing-room," as
they were pleased to call it, perhaps because it
opened into a smaller chamber in which my two
aunts slept. I remember the common-looking carpet
with its chocolate ground, and painted press with
shelves above for books, and Jane's piano, and an
oval looking-glass that hung between the windows;
but the charm of the room with its scanty furniture
and cheaply painted walls must have been, for those
old enough to understand it, the flow of native wit,
with all the fun and nonsense of a large and clever
family.' Such was the room in which the first
versions of <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> and <i>Pride and
Prejudice</i> were composed.</p>

<p>We have anticipated somewhat in describing the
Rectory as it appeared after George Austen's reforms,
and when his children were growing up in it. As it
appeared to him and his wife on their arrival, it must
have left much to be desired.</p>

<p>The young couple who now entered upon a home<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
which was to be theirs for thirty-seven years had
many excellent and attractive qualities. George
Austen's handsome, placid, dignified features were
an index to his mind. Serene in temper, devoted to
his religion and his family, a good father and a good
scholar, he deserved the love and respect which every
evidence that we have shows him to have gained from
his family and his neighbours. His wife's was a
somewhat more positive nature: shrewd and acute,
high-minded and determined, with a strong sense of
humour, and with an energy capable of triumphing
over years of indifferent health, she was ardently
attached to her children, and perhaps somewhat
proud of her ancestors. We are told that she was
very particular about the shape of people's noses,
having a very aristocratic one herself; but we ought
perhaps to add that she admitted she had never been
a beauty, at all events in comparison with her own
elder sister.</p>

<p>If one may divide qualities which often overlap,
one would be inclined to surmise that Jane Austen
inherited from her father her serenity of mind, the
refinement of her intellect, and her delicate appreciation
of style, while her mother supplied the acute
observation of character, and the wit and humour,
for which she was equally distinguished.</p>

<p>Steventon was not the only preferment in the
neighbourhood that George Austen was to hold. His
kind uncle Francis, who had helped him in his
schooling, was anxious to do something more for him.
He would have liked, it is said, to have put him into
the comfortable living of West Wickham in Kent,
which was in the gift of his wife; but he considered
that another nephew, the son of a brother older
than George's father, had a prior claim. Francis,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
however, did the best thing he could by buying the
next presentations of two parishes near Steventon&mdash;namely,
Ashe and Deane&mdash;that his nephew might
have whichever fell vacant first.</p>

<p>The chances of an early vacancy at Ashe, where
Dr. Russell&mdash;the grandfather of Mary Russell Mitford&mdash;had
been established since 1729, must have seemed
the greater; but fate decided otherwise. Dr. Russell
lived till 1783, and it was Deane that first fell vacant,
in 1773.</p>

<p>The writer of the <i>Memoir</i>, who was under the
impression that George Austen became Rector of both
Steventon and Deane in 1764, states that the Austens
began their married life in the parsonage at Deane,
and did not move to Steventon till 1771, seven years
later. This cannot be quite correct, because we have
letters of George Austen dated from Steventon in
1770; nor is it quite easy to understand why Mr.
Austen should have lived in some one else's Rectory
in preference to his own, unless we conceive that the
Rector of Deane was non-resident, and that George
Austen did duty at Deane and rented the parsonage
while his own was under repair. It seems impossible
now to unravel this skein. The story of the move to
Steventon, in 1771, is connected with a statement that
the road was then a mere cart-track, so cut up by deep
ruts as to be impassable for a light carriage, and that
Mrs. Austen (who was not then in good health)
performed the short journey on a feather-bed, placed
upon some soft articles of furniture in the waggon
which held their household goods. This story is too
circumstantial to be without foundation, nor is there
any reason to doubt the badness of a country lane;
but the particular family-flitting referred to must be
left uncertain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>George Austen was thirty-three years old when he
settled down at his Hampshire living. His wife was
some eight years younger. Their means were not
large, but George was able to supplement his income
both by farming and by taking pupils. Life too was
simpler in those days; and we read of Mrs. Austen
being without a new gown for two years, and spending
much of the time in a red riding-habit, which
even then had not finished its usefulness, for it
was cut up some years later into a suit for one
of her boys. Her time, indeed, was soon busily
employed; her eldest boy, James, was born on
February 13, 1765; the second, George, on August 26,
1766; and the third, Edward, on October 7, 1767.
The Austens followed what was a common custom
in those days&mdash;namely, that of putting out their
children to nurse. An honest woman in Deane
had charge of them all in turn, and we are told
that one or both of their parents visited them
every day.</p>

<p>The only excitements to vary the tranquil life
at Steventon were occasional visits to or from their
near relations. Cassandra's brother was now living
on his property called Scarlets, at Hare Hatch,
in the parish of Wargrave, and was thus within
a day's journey from Steventon. He had married
a Miss Cholmeley, of Easton in Lincolnshire, but
they had no children. Cassandra's only sister, Jane
(the beauty of the family), was married at the end
of 1768 to Dr. Cooper, Rector of Whaddon, near
Bath. Edward Cooper was the son of Gislingham
Cooper, a banker in the Strand, by Ann Whitelock,
heiress of Phyllis Court and Henley Manor. Dr. and
Mrs. Cooper divided their time between his house
at Southcote, near Reading, and Bath&mdash;from which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
latter place no doubt he could keep an eye on his
neighbouring parish. The Coopers had two children,
Edward and Jane. They and the Austens were on
very intimate terms, and it is probable that Jane
Austen's early knowledge of Bath was to a great
extent owing to the visits paid to them in that place.
Another family with whom the Austens were on
cousinly terms were the Cookes. Samuel Cooke,
Rector of Little Bookham in Surrey and godfather
to Jane, had married a daughter of the Master of
Balliol (Theophilus Leigh), and their three children,
Theophilus, Mary, and George, belonged, like the
Coopers, to an inner circle of relations on both
sides (Leigh Perrots, Coopers, Cookes, Walters, and
Hancocks), who made up&mdash;in addition to the outer-circle
of country neighbours&mdash;the world in which
the Austens moved.</p>

<p>A few letters addressed to Mr. and Mrs. Walter
(extracts from which we shall venture to quote) will
give the best idea of the happy, peaceful life passed
at Steventon Rectory during these early years. On
July 8, 1770, George writes from Steventon of his
wife's journey to London to be present at the birth
of her sister's child, and adds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. My James .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and his brother are both
well, and what will surprise you, bear their mother's
absence with great philosophy, as I doubt not they
would mine, and turn all their little affections towards
those who were about them and good to them; this
may not be a pleasing reflection to a fond parent, but
is certainly wisely designed by Providence for the
happiness of the child.</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>
<p>A month or so later Cassandra is back again, and
writing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I was not so happy as to see my nephew Weaver<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>&mdash;suppose
he was hurried in time, as I think everyone
is in town; 'tis a sad place, I would not live in it on
any account, one has not time to do one's duty either
to God or man.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What luck we shall have with
those sort of cows I can't say. My little Alderney
one turns out tolerably well, and makes more butter
than we use, and I have just bought another of the
same sort, but as her calf is but just gone, cannot say
what she will be good for yet.</p>

<p><i>December 9, 1770.</i>&mdash;My poor little George is come
to see me to-day, he seems pretty well, tho' he had
a fit lately; it was near a twelve-month since he had
one before, so was in hopes they had left him, but
must not flatter myself so now.</p></div>

<p>In June 1771, the Austens' fourth child, Henry,
was born, and Mrs. Austen writes on November 8,
1772:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>My little boy is come home from nurse, and a fine,
stout little fellow he is, and can run anywhere, so now
I have all four at home, and some time in January
I expect a fifth, so you see it will not be in my power
to take any journeys for one while.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I believe
my sister Hancock will be so good as to come and
nurse me again.</p></div>

<p>Unfortunately, poor little George never recovered
sufficiently to take his place in the family, and we hear
no more of him, though he lived on as late as 1827.</p>

<p>The fifth child, Cassandra, was born in January
1773, and on June 6, 1773, Mrs. Austen writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We will not give up the hopes of seeing you both
(and as many of your young people as you can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
conveniently bring) at Steventon before the summer
is over. Mr. Austen wants to show his brother his
lands and his cattle and many other matters; and I
want to show you my Henry and my Cassy, who are
both reckoned fine children. Jemmy and Neddy are
very happy in a new playfellow, Lord Lymington,
whom Mr. Austen has lately taken the charge of; he
is between five and six years old, very backward of
his age, but good-tempered and orderly. He is the
eldest son of Lord Portsmouth, who lives about ten
miles from hence.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have got a nice dairy fitted
up, and am now worth a bull and six cows, and you
would laugh to see them; for they are not much
bigger than Jack-asses&mdash;and here I have got duckies
and ducks and chickens for Phyllis's amusement.
In short you must come, and, like Hezekiah, I will
show you all my riches.</p>

<p><i>December 12, 1773.</i>&mdash;I thank God we are all
quite well and my little girl is almost ready to run
away. Our new pupil, Master Vanderstegen, has
been with us about a month, he is near fourteen years
old, and is very good tempered and well disposed.
Lord Lymington has left us, his mamma began to
be alarmed at the hesitation in his speech, which
certainly grew worse, and is going to take him to
London in hopes a Mr. Angier (who undertakes to
cure that disorder) may be of service to him.</p></div>

<p>A sixth child, Francis William, was born in
April 1774.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>August 20, 1775.</i>&mdash;We are all, I thank God, in
good health, and I am more nimble and active than
I was last time, expect to be confined some time in
November. My last boy is very stout, and has run
alone these two months, and is not yet sixteen months
old. My little girl talks all day long, and in my
opinion is a very entertaining companion. Henry has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
been in breeches some months, and thinks himself
near as good a man as his brother Neddy. Indeed
no one would judge by their looks that there was
above three years and a half difference in their ages,
one is so little and the other so great. Master Van.
is got very well again, and has been with us again
these three months; he is gone home this morning
for a few holidays.</p></div>

<p>The new infant, however, did not appear quite
so soon as was expected, and the last letter of the
series is written by George Austen on December 17,
1775.</p>



<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'><br />Steventon: December 17, 1775.
</div><p><span class="smcap">Dear Sister</span>,&mdash;You have doubtless been for some
time in expectation of hearing from Hampshire,
and perhaps wondered a little we were in our old
age grown such bad reckoners, but so it was, for
Cassy certainly expected to have been brought to
bed a month ago; however, last night the time
came, and without a great deal of warning, everything
was soon happily over. We have now another
girl, a present plaything for her sister Cassy, and a
future companion. She is to be Jenny, and seems
to me as if she would be as like Harry as Cassy is
to Neddy. Your sister, thank God, is pure well
after it.</p></div>

<p>George Austen's prediction was fully justified.
Never were sisters more to each other than Cassandra
and Jane; while in a particularly affectionate family
there seems to have been a special link between
Cassandra and Edward on the one hand, and between
Jane and Henry on the other.</p>

<p>Jane's godparents were Mrs. Musgrave (a connexion
of her mother's), Mrs. Francis Austen (another
Jane), wife of George's kind uncle, and Samuel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Cooke, Rector of Little Bookham. We may suppose
that, like the rest of her family, she spent a considerable
part of the first eighteen months of her
existence at the good woman's at Deane.</p>

<p>We have, indeed, but little information about
the household at Steventon for the next few years.
Another child&mdash;the last&mdash;Charles, was born in June
1779. There must, as the children grew older, have
been a bright and lively family party to fill the
Rectory, all the more so because the boys were educated
at home instead of being sent to any school.
One of George Austen's sons has described him as
being 'not only a profound scholar, but possessed of
a most exquisite taste in every species of literature';
and, even if we allow for some filial exaggeration,
there can be no doubt that it was a home where good
teaching&mdash;in every sense of the word&mdash;good taste, and
a general love of reading prevailed. To balance this
characteristic the Austen nature possessed yet another&mdash;spread
over many members of the family&mdash;namely,
an enthusiastic love of sport. The boys hunted from
an early age, in a scrambling sort of way, upon any
pony or donkey that they could procure, or, in
default of such luxuries, on foot; perhaps beginning
the day with an early breakfast in the kitchen.
A wonderful story is told, on good authority, of a
piece of amateur horse-dealing accomplished by the
youngest son but one, Francis, at the mature age of
seven: how he bought on his own account (it must
be supposed with his father's permission) a pony for
&pound;1 11<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.;</i> hunted it, jumping everything that the
pony could get its nose over; and at the end of two
years sold it again for &pound;2 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> It was a bright
chestnut, and he called it 'Squirrel'; though his
elder brothers, to plague him, called it 'Scug.' This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
was the boy for whose benefit his mother converted
into a jacket and trousers the scarlet riding-habit
which played so important a part in her early married
life. If he mounted 'Squirrel' in this costume, the
future Admiral of the Fleet was hunting 'in pink'
with a vengeance, and must have contributed not a
little to the gaiety of the field.</p>

<p>It is evident that part of the good training at
Steventon consisted in making the boys, while quite
young, manly, active, and self-reliant. When the
time came for their leaving home they would not be
found unprepared.</p>

<p>Mr. Austen found it a pleasant task to educate
his own sons with his other pupils, and thereby to
dispense with the cost of public schools. We get a
glimpse of him as a teacher in a letter of his son
Henry, written many years later to Warren Hastings.
Henry, by the way, made use of a style that one is
thankful Jane did not adopt.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Suffer me to say that among the earliest lessons
of my infancy I was taught by precept and example
to love and venerate your name. I cannot remember
the time when I did not associate with your character
the idea of everything great, amiable, and good.
Your benevolence was a theme on which my young
attention hung with truer worship than courtiers
ever pay the throne. Your works of taste, both of
the pencil and the pen, were continually offered to
my notice as objects of imitation and spurs to
exertion. I shall never forget the delight which I
experienced when, on producing a translation of a
well-known Ode of Horace to my father's criticism,
he favoured me with a perusal of your manuscript,
and as a high mark of commendation said that he
was sure Mr. Hastings would have been pleased with
the perusal of my humble essay.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>There is also a pleasant picture of home life at
Steventon drawn for us in the <i>History of the Leigh
Family</i>, in which the writer speaks of Cassandra,
'wife of the truly respectable Mr. Austen,' and adds:
'With his sons (all promising to make figures in
life), Mr. Austen educates a few youths of chosen
friends and acquaintances. When among this liberal
society, the simplicity, hospitality, and taste which
commonly prevail in affluent families among the
delightful valleys of Switzerland ever recur to my
memory.'</p>

<p>But though it might be an easy thing to educate
his sons at home, it was another matter to teach
his daughters, and, according to a family tradition,
Cassandra and Jane were dispatched at a very early
age to spend a year at Oxford with Mrs. Cawley, a
sister of Dr. Cooper&mdash;a fact which makes it likely
that their cousin, Jane Cooper, was also of the party.
Mrs. Cawley was the widow of a Principal of Brasenose
College, and is said to have been a stiff-mannered
person. She moved presently to Southampton, and
there also had the three girls under her charge. At
the latter place Cassandra and Jane Austen were
attacked by a putrid fever. Mrs. Cawley would not
write word of this to Steventon, but Jane Cooper
thought it right to do so, upon which Mrs. Austen
and Mrs. Cooper set off at once for Southampton
and took their daughters away. Jane Austen was
very ill and nearly died. Worse befell poor Mrs.
Cooper, who took the infection and died at Bath
whither she had returned. As Mrs. Cooper died in
October 1783, this fixes the date roughly when the
sisters went to Oxford and Southampton. Jane
would have been full young to profit from the instruction
of masters at Oxford (she can hardly have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
been seven years old when she went there), and it
must have been more for the sake of her being with
Cassandra than for any other reason that she was sent.</p>

<p>On the same principle, she went to school at
Reading soon after the Southampton experience.
'Not,' we are told, 'because she was thought old
enough to profit much by the instruction there imparted,
but because she would have been miserable
without her sister'; her mother, in fact, observing
that 'if Cassandra were going to have her head cut
off, Jane would insist on sharing her fate.'</p>

<p>The school chosen was a famous one in its day&mdash;namely,
the Abbey School in the Forbury at Reading,
kept by a Mrs. Latournelle, an Englishwoman
married to a Frenchman. Miss Butt, afterwards
Mrs. Sherwood, who went to the same school in 1790,
says in her Autobiography<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> that Mrs. Latournelle
never could speak a word of French; indeed, she
describes her as 'a person of the old school, a stout
woman, hardly under seventy, but very active,
although she had a cork leg.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She was only fit
for giving out clothes for the wash, and mending
them, making tea, ordering dinner, and in fact doing
the work of a housekeeper.'</p>

<p>But in Mrs. Sherwood's time she had a capable
assistant in Madame St. Quentin, an Englishwoman,
married to the son of a nobleman in Alsace, who in
troubled times had been glad to accept the position
of French teacher at Reading Grammar School under
Dr. Valpy. Mrs. Sherwood says that the St. Quentins
so entirely raised the credit of the seminary that
when she went there it contained above sixty
pupils. The history of the school did not end with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Reading, for the St. Quentins afterwards removed to
22 Hans Place, where they had under their charge
Mary Russell Mitford. Still later, after the fall of
Napoleon, the St. Quentins moved to Paris, together
with Miss Rowden, who had long been the mainstay
of the school. It was while the school was here that
it received Fanny Kemble among its pupils.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Sherwood tells us that the school-house at
Reading, 'or rather the abbey itself, was exceedingly
interesting, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the ancient building .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. consisted
of a gateway with rooms above, and on each side
of it a vast staircase, of which the balustrades
had originally been gilt.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The best part of
the house was encompassed by a beautiful, old-fashioned
garden, where the young ladies were
allowed to wander under tall trees in hot summer
evenings.'</p>

<p>Discipline was not severe, for the same lady
informs us: 'The liberty which the first class had
was so great that if we attended our tutor in his study
for an hour or two every morning .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no human
being ever took the trouble to inquire where else we
spent the rest of the day between our meals. Thus,
whether we gossiped in one turret or another, whether
we lounged about the garden, or out of the window
above the gateway, no one so much as said "Where
have you been, mademoiselle?"'</p>

<p>After reading this we are no longer surprised
to be told that Cassandra and Jane, together with
their cousin, Jane Cooper, were allowed to accept
an invitation to dine at an inn with their respective
brothers, Edward Austen and Edward Cooper, and
some of their young friends.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>
<p>School life does not appear to have left any
very deep impression on Jane Austen.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Probably she
went at too youthful an age, and her stay was too
short. At any rate, none of the heroines of her
novels, except Anne Elliot,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> are sent to school,
though it is likely enough, as several writers have
pointed out, that her Reading experiences suggested
Mrs. Goddard's school in <i>Emma</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Mrs. Goddard was the mistress of a school&mdash;not
of a seminary, or an establishment, or anything which
professed, in long sentences of refined nonsense, to
combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality
upon new principles and new systems&mdash;and where
young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out
of health and into vanity, but a real, honest, old-fashioned
boarding-school, where a reasonable quantity
of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable
price, and where girls might be sent to be out of the
way, and scramble themselves into a little education,
without any danger of coming back prodigies. Mrs.
Goddard's school was in high repute.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She had an
ample house and garden, gave the children plenty of
wholesome food, let them run about a great deal in
the summer, and in winter dressed their chilblains
with her own hands. It was no wonder that a train
of twenty young couples now walked after her to
church. She was a plain, motherly kind of woman.</p></div>

<p>Jane herself finished her schooling at the early age<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
of nine. The rest of her education was completed at
home. Probably her father taught her in his leisure
hours, and James, when he was at home, gave her
many useful hints. Father, mother, and eldest
brother were all fully capable of helping her, and
perhaps even Cassandra did her share. But for the
most part her culture must have been self-culture,
such as she herself imagined in the case of Elizabeth
Bennet. Later on, the French of Reading Abbey
school was corrected and fortified by the lessons of her
cousin Eliza. On the whole, she grew up with a good
stock of such accomplishments as might be expected
of a girl bred in one of the more intellectual of the
clerical houses of that day. She read French easily,
and knew a little of Italian; and she was well read in
the English literature of the eighteenth century. As a
child, she had strong political opinions, especially on
the affairs of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
She was a vehement defender of Charles I and his
grandmother, Mary, and did not disdain to make
annotations in this sense (which still exist) on the
margin of her Goldsmith's <i>History</i>. As she grew up,
the party politics of the day seem to have occupied
very little of her attention, but she probably shared
the feeling of moderate Toryism which prevailed in
her family. Politics in their larger aspect&mdash;revolution
and war&mdash;were of course very real at that date
to every patriotic citizen, and came home with
especial force to the Austens, whose cousin's
husband perished by the guillotine,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and whose
brothers were constantly fighting on the sea. In her
last published sentence at the end of <i>Persuasion</i> the
author <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'tell'">tells</ins> us how her Anne Elliot 'gloried' in being
the wife of a sailor; and no doubt she had a similar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
feeling with regard to her two naval brothers. But
there was then no daily authentic intelligence of
events as they occurred. Newspapers were a luxury
of the rich in those days, and it need excite no surprise
to find that the events are very seldom mentioned
in Jane's surviving letters.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>We can be in no doubt as to her fervent, and
rather exclusive, love for her own country. Writing
to an old friend, within a few months of her own
death, she says: 'I hope your letters from abroad
are satisfactory. They would not be satisfactory to
<i>me</i>, I confess, unless they breathed a strong spirit of
regret for not being in England.'</p>

<p>Of her favourite authors and favourite pursuits,
we will speak later.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>WARREN HASTINGS AND THE HANCOCKS</h3>

<h3>1752-1794</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>The</span> title of this chapter may seem at first sight to
remove it far from the life of Jane Austen; but Mrs.
Hancock (who had been Philadelphia Austen) was her
aunt, and Eliza Hancock not only a cousin but also
a close friend; and both were always welcome visitors
at Steventon. The varying fortunes of these
ladies would therefore be an object of constant
thought and discussion at the Rectory, and Jane
had an early opportunity of becoming interested
in the affairs both of India and of France.</div>

<p>How the acquaintance of the family with Warren
Hastings began, we cannot exactly say; but it certainly
lasted long, and resulted on their side in an
admiration for his genius and his kindness, and a
readiness to defend him when he was attacked.</p>

<p>In one of Jane's early unpublished sketches occurs
the following passage:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The eldest daughter had been obliged to accept
the offer of one of her cousins to equip her for the East
Indies, and tho' infinitely against her inclinations,
had been necessitated to embrace the only possibility
that was offered to her of a maintenance; yet it was
one so opposite to all her ideas of propriety, so contrary
to her wishes, so repugnant to her feelings, that
she would almost have preferred servitude to it, had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
choice been allowed her. Her personal attractions
had gained her a husband as soon as she had arrived
at Bengal, and she had now been married nearly
a twelvemonth&mdash;splendidly, yet unhappily married.
United to a man of double her own age, whose disposition
was not amiable, and whose manners were
unpleasing, though his character was respectable.</p></div>

<p>When Jane wrote this she may have been thinking
of her father's sister, Philadelphia, whose fate is described
not very incorrectly, though with a certain
amount of exaggeration, in this passage. That
Philadelphia Austen went to seek her fortune in India
is certain, and that she did so reluctantly is extremely
likely. She had at an early age been left an orphan
without means or prospects, and the friends who
brought her up may have settled the matter for her.
Who those friends were, we do not know; but from
the intimate terms on which she continued through
life&mdash;not only with her brother, George Austen, but
also, in a less degree, with her half-brother, William
Walter&mdash;it is probable that she had spent much of
her youth with her mother's family.</p>

<p>Her brother George, however, as a young man,
was poor, and had no home to offer her; but the
banishment which threatened entirely to separate
the brother and sister proved in the end to have a
contrary effect. Philadelphia did in time come back
to England, as a wife and as the mother of one
daughter, and her husband's subsequent return to
India caused her to depend much for companionship
upon her English relations. At Steventon little
Betsy would find playfellows, somewhat younger
than herself, in the elder Austen children, while her
mother was discussing the last news from India with
the heads of the family.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Our first definite information about Philadelphia
is, that in November 1751 she petitioned the Court
of East India Directors for leave to go to friends
at Fort St. David by the <i>Bombay Castle;</i> but who
these friends were, or what induced her to take so
adventurous a journey in search of them, we cannot
say. Her sureties were also sureties for a certain
Mary Elliott, so they may have been friends intending
to travel together. But, according to Sydney Grier's
conjecture, Mary Elliott did not, after all, sail in
the <i>Bombay Castle</i>, but remained behind to marry a
certain Captain Buchanan, sailing with him to India
the following year. Captain Buchanan lost his life
in the Black Hole, and his widow (whether she was
Mary Elliott or not) married Warren Hastings. By
her second husband she had two children, a son,
George, born about 1758, and a daughter born about
1759 who lived only three weeks. The short history
of the boy we have already told. Mrs. Hastings died
on July 11, 1759, at Cossinbazar.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Philadelphia reached Madras on August 4, 1752.
It is probable that in those days no girl was long in
India without receiving offers of marriage. In fact,
Dr. Hancock writing twenty years later, to deprecate
his daughter's coming out to India, says to Philadelphia
'You know very well that no girl, tho' but
fourteen years old, can arrive in India without
attracting the notice of every coxcomb in the place;
you yourself know how impossible it is for a young
girl to avoid being attached to a young handsome man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
whose address is agreeable to her.' If there <i>was</i> any
handsome young man in Philadelphia's case, it was
probably not Mr. Hancock, who must have been
forty or more when he married her at Cuddalore on
February 22, 1753. The name of Tysoe Saul Hancock
appears in the list of European inhabitants at Fort St.
David for 1753, as surgeon, at &pound;36 per annum; and at
Fort St. David he and Philadelphia remained for three
years after their marriage. Where the Hancocks
were during the troublous times which began in 1757
is not known; but by the beginning of 1762 they were
certainly in Calcutta, for their daughter Elizabeth&mdash;better
known as Betsy&mdash;was born there in December
1761. Warren Hastings, at this time resident at
Murshidabad, was godfather to Elizabeth, who received
the name he had intended to give to his own
infant daughter. The origin of the close intimacy
that existed between the Hancocks and Warren
Hastings is uncertain; but if Mary Elliott really
became the wife of the latter, the friendship of the
two women may perhaps explain the great obligation
under which Hastings describes himself as being to
Philadelphia.</p>

<p>The news of the death of his little son was the first
thing Hastings heard on landing in England in 1765,
and we are told it left a shadow on his face for years.
He seems always to have been especially fond of
children, and his intimate friends knew they could
give no greater pleasure than by informing him of
the welfare of his favourites, or by sending messages
to them. Thus Marriott, writing to Hastings from
India on August 15, 1765, sends his kisses and salaam
to 'little ("<i>great</i>" I believe I should say) Betsy
Hancock,' and a 'good hearty shake by the hand
to George; I suppose if I were to go to kiss him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
he would give me a box on the ears.&mdash;Write me
particularly how these little ones go.'</p>

<p>It seems likely that the Hancocks sailed with
Warren Hastings for England in the <i>Medway</i> in 1764-5;
but, whenever they went, we learn from Hancock's
letters that the journey home cost them the large
sum of &pound;1500. He (Hancock) no doubt thought that
he had amassed a sufficient fortune&mdash;perhaps from
trading, or from private practice, for it can hardly
have been from his official income&mdash;in India to
enable him to end his days comfortably at home.
But either his Indian investments turned out badly,
or he discovered that living in good style in England
cost much more than he had anticipated; and after
three years he found himself under the disagreeable
necessity of a second residence in Bengal, in order
to secure a fresh provision for his wife and daughter.
So low, indeed, were his finances at the time, that he
was forced to borrow money from Hastings to pay
for his passage out. He reached Calcutta in 1769,
but did not prosper on this second visit. His health
was bad, his trading ventures turned out amiss,
and there were perpetual difficulties about remitting
money home to Philadelphia. Hastings evidently
foresaw how matters would end, and with his wonted
generosity gave a sum amounting at first to &pound;5000,
and increased later to &pound;10,000, in trust for Hancock
and his wife during their lives, and, on the death of
the survivor, to Betsy.</p>

<p>Mr. Hancock himself died in November 1775,
'universally beloved and deeply regretted' (in the
words of a young man whom he had befriended),
'the patron of the widow and the fatherless.'<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
seems indeed to have been a man of affectionate and
anxious disposition, strongly attached to his wife and
daughter; but the last part of his life was passed
away from them amid difficulties and disappointments,
and his spirits were hardly high enough
to enable him to bear up against unequal fortune.
He alludes in his letters, with expressions of regard,
to his brother-in-law, George Austen; but characteristically
deplores his growing family, thinking
that he will not be able to put them out in the
world&mdash;a difficulty which did not eventually prove
to be insuperable.</p>

<p>When the news of his death reached England&mdash;which
would be in about six months' time&mdash;George
Austen and his wife were, fortunately, present to
comfort Philadelphia under the sad tidings. She
and Betsy had now been living in England for ten
years, and had seen, no doubt, much of the Steventon
Austens. Warren Hastings's loyal attachment to the
widow and daughter of his friend remained unchanged,
and they lived on terms of intimacy with his brother-in-law
Woodman and his family. As long as Hancock
lived he wrote constantly to wife and child, and gave
advice&mdash;occasionally, perhaps, of a rather embarrassing
kind&mdash;about the education of the latter. He
discouraged, however, an idea of his wife's that she
should bring Betsy out to India at the age of twelve.
At last Mrs. Hancock, who, though a really good woman,
was over-indulgent to her daughter, was able to fulfil
the chief desire of her own heart, and to take her
abroad to finish her studies, and later to seek an entry
into the great world in Paris. Her husband's affairs
had been left in much confusion, but Hastings's
generous gift of &pound;10,000 put them above want.</p>

<p>Betsy, or rather 'Eliza' ('for what young woman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of common gentility,' as we read in <i>Northanger
Abbey</i>, 'will reach the age of sixteen without altering
her name as far as she can?'), was just grown
up when this great move was made. In years to
come, her connexion with her Steventon cousins was
destined to be a close one; at the present time she
was a very pretty, lively girl, fond of amusements,
and perhaps estimating her own importance a little
too highly. But she had been carefully educated, and
was capable of disinterested attachments. She seems
to have had a special love for her uncle, George Austen,
and one of her earliest letters from Paris, written
May 16, 1780, announces that she is sending to him
her picture in miniature, adding 'It is reckoned like
what I am at present. The dress is quite the present
fashion of what I usually wear.' This miniature is still
in existence, and represents a charming, fresh young
girl, in a low white dress edged with light blue ribbon,
the hair turned up and powdered, with a ribbon of the
same colour passed through it. Our knowledge of
her character at this time is principally derived
from a series of letters written by her to her cousin,
Phila Walter&mdash;letters singularly frank and gossipy,
and of especial interest to us from the sidelights
they throw on the family circle at Steventon. There
are also interesting letters from Phila to her own
family.</p>

<p>Such a girl as Eliza was not likely to pass unnoticed
in any society; and in August 1781 Mr.
Woodman writes to tell Warren Hastings that she
is on the point of marriage with a French officer,
and that 'Mr. Austen is much concerned at the
connexion, which he says is giving up all their
friends, their country, and he fears their religion.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
The intended husband was Jean Capotte, Comte de
Feuillide,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> aged thirty, an officer in the Queen's
Regiment of Dragoons, and owner of an estate called
Le Marais, near Gaboret, in Guyenne. The marriage
took place in the same year, and in the following
March, Eliza, now Comtesse de Feuillide, writes
Phila a long letter praising the Comte and his devotion
to herself.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The man to whom I have given my hand is
everyways amiable both in mind and person. It
is too little to say he loves me, since he literally
adores me; entirely devoted to me, and making
my inclinations the guide of all his actions, the whole
study of his life seems to be to contribute to the
happiness of mine. My situation is everyways agreeable,
certain of never being separated from my dear
Mama, whose presence enhances every other blessing
I enjoy, equally sure of my husband's affection,
mistress of an easy fortune with the prospect of a
very ample one, add to these the advantages of rank
and title, and a numerous and brilliant acquaintance
amongst whom I can flatter myself I have some
sincere friends, and you will unite with me in saying
I have reason to be thankful to Providence for the lot
fallen to my share; the only thing which can make
me uneasy is the distance I am from my relations and
country, but this is what I trust I shall not always
have to complain of, as the Comte has the greatest
desire to see England, and even to make it his residence
a part of the year. We shall certainly make you a visit
as soon as possible after the peace takes place.</p></div>

<p>In the same letter she mentions how gay the
season has been, on account of the birth of the
Dauphin, and of the f&ecirc;tes which accompanied that
event. Neither she nor her 'numerous and brilliant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
acquaintance' had any prevision of the terrible days
that awaited all their order, nor any knowledge of
the existence of the irresistible forces which were soon
to overwhelm them, and to put a tragical end to every
hope cherished by the bride, except that of rejoining
her English friends. For the present, she led a life
of pleasure and gaiety; but that it did not make her
forgetful of Steventon is shown by another letter
to Phila, dated May 7, 1784:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I experienced much pleasure from the account
you gave me of my Uncle Geo: Austen's family;
each of my cousins seems to be everything their parents
could wish them; such intelligence would have given
me the completest satisfaction had it not been accompanied
by the melancholy news of the death of the
valuable Mrs. Cooper. I sincerely lament her loss
and sympathize with the grief it must have occasioned.
Both Mama and myself were very apprehensive of
the influence of this event on my aunt's health, but
fortunately the last accounts from Steventon assure
us that the whole family continue well.</p></div>

<p>On January 19, 1786, she again writes on the
subject of a visit to England, about which she
hesitates, partly because of the state of her health,
and partly because she was expecting a long visit
from her cousin, James Austen (eldest son of George
Austen)&mdash;a young man who, having completed his
undergraduate residence at Oxford, was spending
some months in France.</p>

<p>To England, however, she came, hoping to see
much of the Austen family. 'I mean,' she writes, 'to
spend a very few days in London, and, if my health
allows me, immediately to pay a visit to Steventon,
because my uncle informs us that Midsummer and
Christmas are the only seasons when his mansion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
is sufficiently at liberty to admit of his receiving
his friends.' The rectory was certainly too small a
'mansion' to contain the Comtesse and her mother,
in addition to its own large family party and various
pupils; so it is to be hoped that Eliza carried out her
project in June, before she was otherwise engaged.
She settled for a time in London, at 3 Orchard
Street, and there it must be supposed her one child&mdash;a
little boy&mdash;was born in the autumn, to be named
Hastings after her own godfather. The Comte,
who was himself detained by business in France,
had, for some unexplained reason, desired that their
child might be born in England. Whether she went
again to Steventon at Christmas is uncertain, for her
next letter is dated April 9, 1787. Eliza was then
in town and expecting a visit from her cousin, Henry
Austen&mdash;by this time a youth of sixteen about to go
into residence at Oxford. She had been indulging in
such gaieties as London had to offer her.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>As to me, I have been for some time past the
greatest rake imaginable, and really wonder how such
a meagre creature as I am can support so much
fatigue, of which the history of one day will give you
some idea, for I only stood from two to four in the
drawing-room and of course loaded with a great hoop
of no inconsiderable weight, went to the Duchess of
Cumberland's in the evening and from thence to
Almack's, where I staid till five in the morning: all
this I did not many days ago, and am yet alive to
tell you of it. I believe tho', I should not be able to
support London hours, and all the racketing of a
London life for a year together. You are very good
in your enquiries after my little boy who is in perfect
health, but has got no teeth yet, which somewhat
mortifies his two Mamas.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Eliza's domestic cares and her gaieties must still
have left her some time to think with anxiety and
apprehension of the impeachment of her godfather and
benefactor, Hastings. We have a glimpse of this in
a letter of Phila Walter, who was staying with her aunt
and cousin in Orchard Street, in April 1788. They
went to the trial one day 'and sat from ten till four,
completely tired; but I had the satisfaction of hearing
all the celebrated orators&mdash;Sheridan, Burke, and Fox.
The first was so low we could not hear him, the
second so hot and hasty we could not understand,
the third was highly superior to either, as we could
distinguish every word, but not to our satisfaction,
as he is so much against Mr. Hastings whom we all
wish so well.'</p>

<p>In August 1788, Eliza writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>What has contributed to hurry me and take up
my time is my having been obliged to pay some
visits out of town. We spent a little time at Beaumont
Lodge,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and I am but just returned from an
excursion into Berkshire, during which we made some
little stay at Oxford. My cousin<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> met us there, and as
well as his brother was so good as to take the trouble
of shewing us the lions. We visited several of the
Colleges, the Museum, etc., and were very elegantly
entertained by our gallant relations at St. John's,
where I was mightily taken with the garden and
longed to be a <i>Fellow</i> that I might walk in it every
day; besides I was delighted with the black gown
and thought the square cap mighty becoming. I
do not think you would know Henry with his hair
powdered in a very <i>tonish</i> style, besides he is at
present taller than his father.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>You mention the troubles in France, but you will
easily imagine from what I have said concerning
my approaching journey, that things are in a quieter
state than they were some months ago. Had they
continued as they were it is most probable M. de F.
would have been called out, and it would have been
a very unpleasant kind of duty because he must
have borne arms against his own countrymen.</p></div>

<p>We hear but little of Eliza during the next two
or three years, which she seems to have spent partly
in France, partly in England. She must have been
much engrossed by the stirring events in Paris, the
result of which was eventually to prove fatal to her
husband.</p>

<p>In January 1791 she is at Margate for the benefit
of her boy, and, though the place is very empty,
occupies herself with reading, music, drawing, &amp;c.
She adds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>M. de F. had given me hopes of his return to
England this winter, but the turn which the affairs of
France have taken will not allow him to quit the
Continent at this juncture. I know not whether I
have already mentioned it to you, but my <i>spouse</i>,
who is a strong <i>Aristocrate</i> or Royalist in his heart,
has joined this latter party who have taken refuge
in Piedmont, and is now at Turin where the French
Princes of the Blood are assembled and watching
some favourable opportunity to reinstate themselves
in the country they have quitted. I am no politician,
but think they will not easily accomplish their purpose;
time alone can decide this matter, and in the
interim you will easily imagine I cannot be wholly
unconcerned about events which must inevitably in
some degree influence my future destiny.</p></div>

<p>Eliza had another terrible anxiety in June 1791,
in the failure of her mother's health. In September<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
she is hoping for a visit from her husband, when,
if her mother's health allows, they will all go to
Bath,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">a journey from which I promise myself much pleasure,
as I have a notion it is a place quite after my own
heart; however, the accomplishment of this plan
is very uncertain, as from the present appearance of
things, France will probably be engaged in a war
which will not admit of an officer's (whose services
will certainly be required) quitting his country at
such a period.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. My mother has this very
morning received a letter from Steventon, where
they all enjoy perfect health. The youngest boy,
Charles, is gone to the Naval Academy at Portsmouth.
As to the young ladies, I hear they are
perfect Beauties, and of course gain hearts by
dozens.</div>

<p>In November she says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Edward A. I believe will .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in another month
or two take unto himself a spouse. He shewed me
the lady's picture, which is that of a very pretty
woman; as to Cassandra, it is very probable, as you
observe, that some son of Neptune may have obtained
her approbation as she probably experienced much
homage from these gallant gentlemen during her
acquatic excursions. I hear her sister and herself
are two of the prettiest girls in England.</p></div>

<p>Mrs. Hancock died in the winter of 1791-2, and
our next letter from Eliza is not till June 7, 1792.
In the interval she had been&mdash;together with M. de
Feuillide, who had perhaps come over to attend
the death-bed of Philadelphia&mdash;to Bath, from which
place she had derived little amusement owing to the
state of her spirits. Returning to London, M. de
Feuillide had hoped to stay there some time;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">but he soon received accounts from France which
informed him that, having already exceeded his leave
of absence, if he still continued in England he would
be considered as one of the Emigrants, and consequently
his whole property forfeited to the nation.
Such advices were not to be neglected, and M. de F.
was obliged to depart for Paris, but not, however,
without giving me hopes of his return in some months,
that is to say, when the state of affairs would let him,
for at present it is a very difficult business, for a
military man especially, to obtain leave to absent
himself.</div>

<p>On September 26 she writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I can readily believe that the share of sensibility
I know you to be possessed of would not suffer you
to learn the tragical events of which France has of late
been the theatre, without being much affected. My
private letters confirm the intelligence afforded by
the public prints, and assure me that nothing we
there read is exaggerated. M. de F. is at present in
Paris. He had determined on coming to England,
but finds it impossible to get away.</p></div>

<p>The crisis of her husband's fate was not far distant.
How the tragedy was led up to by the events of 1793,
we do not know; but in February 1794 he was
arrested on the charge of suborning witnesses in
favour of the Marquise de Marb&oelig;uf. The Marquise
had been accused of conspiring against the Republic
in 1793;<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> one of the chief counts against her being
that she had laid down certain arable land on her
estate at Champs, near Meaux, in lucerne, sainfoin,
and clover, with the object of producing a famine.
The Marquise, by way of defence, printed a memorial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
of her case, stating, among other things, that she
had not done what she was accused of doing, and
further, that if she had, she had a perfect right to do
what she liked with her own property. But it was
evident that things were likely to go hard with the
Marquise at her trial. The Comte de Feuillide then
came upon the scene, and attempted to bribe Morel,
one of the Secretaries of the Committee of Safety,
to suppress incriminating documents, and even to
bear witness in her favour. Morel drew the Count on,
and then betrayed him. The Marquise, her agent
and the Count were all condemned to death, and the
Count suffered the penalty on February 22, 1794.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>We cannot tell where Eliza was through this
trying time. The tradition in the family is that she
escaped through dangers and difficulties to England
and found a refuge at Steventon; but we have no
positive information of her having returned to France
at all. It is quite possible that she was at Steventon,
and if so, the horror-struck party must have felt as
though they were brought very near to the guillotine.
It was an event to make a lasting impression on
a quick-witted and emotional girl of eighteen, and
Eliza remained so closely linked with the family
that the tragedy probably haunted Jane's memory
for a long time to come.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>FAMILY LIFE</h3>

<h3>1779-1792</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>The</span> eldest brother of the family, James, was nearly
eleven years older than Jane, and had taken his
degree at Oxford before she left school. He had
matriculated at St. John's (where he obtained a
'founder's kin' Scholarship and, subsequently, a
Fellowship) in 1779, at the early age of fourteen; his
departure from home having been perhaps hastened
in order to make room for the three or four pupils
who were sharing his brothers' studies at that time.
His was a scholarly type of mind; he was well read
in English literature, had a correct taste, and wrote
readily and happily, both in prose and verse. His
son, the author of the <i>Memoir</i>, believes that he had
a large share in directing the reading, and forming
the taste, of his sister Jane. James was evidently
in sympathy with Cowper's return to nature from
the more artificial and mechanical style of Pope's
imitators, and so was she; in <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>,
Marianne, after her first conversation with Willoughby,
had happily assured herself of his admiring
Pope 'no more than is proper.' In 1786 we hear of
James being in France; his cousin Eliza was hoping
for a visit of some months from him; but in the
next year he had returned, and he must have soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
gone into residence at Oxford as a young Fellow of
his College; for there, in 1789, he became the originator
and chief author of a periodical paper called <i>The
Loiterer</i>, modelled on <i>The Spectator</i> and its successors.
It existed for more than a twelvemonth,
and in the last number the whole was offered to the
world as a 'rough, but not entirely inaccurate Sketch
of the Character, the Manners, and the Amusements
of Oxford, at the close of the eighteenth century.'
In after life, we are told, he used to speak very
slightingly of this early work, 'which he had the
better right to do, as, whatever may have been the
degree of their merits, the best papers had certainly
been written by himself.'</div>

<p>Edward Austen's disposition and tastes were as
different from James's as his lot in life proved to be.
Edward, as his mother says, 'made no pretensions'
to literary taste and scholarship; but he was an
excellent man of business, kind-hearted and affectionate;
and he possessed also a spirit of fun and
liveliness, which made him&mdash;as time went on&mdash;especially
delightful to all young people. His
history was more like fiction than reality. Most
children have at some time or other indulged in day-dreams,
in which they succeed to unexpected estates
and consequent power; and it all happened to
Edward. Mr. Thomas Knight of Godmersham Park
in Kent, and Chawton House in Hampshire, had
married a second cousin of George Austen, and had
placed him in his Rectory at Steventon. His son,
another Thomas Knight, and his charming wife,
Catherine Knatchbull, took a fancy to young Edward,
had him often to their house, and eventually adopted
him. The story remains in the family of Mr. and
Mrs. Knight's asking for the company of young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Edward during his holidays, of his father's hesitating
in the interests of the Latin Grammar, and of his
mother's clinching the matter by saying 'I think,
my dear, you had better oblige your cousins and let
the child go.' There was no issue of the marriage of
Mr. and Mrs. Knight, and by degrees they made up
their minds to adopt Edward Austen as their heir.
This resolution was not only a mark of their regard
for Edward but also a compliment to the Austen
family in general, whose early promise their cousins
had probably observed; the relationship not being
near enough to constitute any claim. But Mr.
Knight was most serious in his intentions, for in his
will he left the estates in remainder to Edward's
brothers in succession in case of the failure of his
issue, and Mrs. Knight always showed the kindest
interest in all the family. Edward was now more
and more at Godmersham and less and less at
home. Under the Knights' auspices, he was sent,
not to the University, but on a 'grand tour,'
which included Dresden and Rome. He was probably
away on this tour at the date which we have
now reached.</p>

<p>Jane's favourite brother, Henry, was nearly four
years younger than Edward, and was no doubt still
profiting by his father's instructions. By 1789 he
was not only at Oxford but was contributing to
<i>The Loiterer</i> a paper on the sentimental school of
Rousseau, and considering 'how far the indulgence
of the above-named sentiments affects the immediate
happiness or misery of human life.' Henry, whose
course in life was marked by sharper curves than
that of any of his brothers, was no doubt a very
attractive personality. His niece, Mrs. Lefroy, says
of him:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He was the handsomest of his family and, in
the opinion of his own father, also the most talented.
There were others who formed a different estimate,
and considered his abilities greater in show than in
reality; but for the most part he was greatly admired.
Brilliant in conversation he was, and, like his father,
blessed with a hopefulness of temper which in adapting
itself to all circumstances, even the most adverse,
seemed to create a perpetual sunshine. The race,
however, is not all to the swift, it never has been,
and, though so highly gifted by nature, my uncle
was not prosperous in life.</p></div>

<p>There can be no doubt that by his bright and
lovable nature he contributed greatly to the happiness
of his sister Jane. She tells us that he could not
help being amusing, and she was so good a judge of
that quality that we accept her opinion of Henry's
humour without demur; but he became so grandiloquent
when wishing to be serious that he certainly
must have wanted that last and rarest gift of a
humorist&mdash;the art of laughing at himself.</p>

<p>Very different again was the self-contained and
steadfast Francis&mdash;the future Admiral of the Fleet;
who was born in April 1774, and divided in age
from Henry by their sister Cassandra. He must
have spent some time at home with his sisters, after
their return from school, before he entered the Royal
Naval Academy, established in 1775 at Portsmouth
under the supreme direction of the Lords of the
Admiralty. Francis joined it when he was just
twelve, and, 'having attracted the particular notice
of the Lords of the Admiralty by the closeness of his
application, and been in consequence marked out for
early promotion,'<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> embarked two and a half years<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
later as a volunteer on board the frigate <i>Perseverance</i>
(captain, Isaac Smith), bound to the East Indies.
His father on this occasion wrote him a long letter&mdash;of
which a great part is given in <i>Jane Austen's Sailor
Brothers</i>.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Nothing in this wise and kind letter is
more remarkable than the courtesy and delicacy with
which the father addresses his advice to the son, who
was but a boy, but whom he treats as an officer, and
as a young man of whom he already cherished the
highest hopes, consequent upon his previous good
conduct. He speaks on many topics, religious duties
being given the first place among them. He rejoices
in the high character Francis had acquired in the
academy and assures him that 'your good mother,
brothers, sisters and myself will all exult in your
reputation and rejoice in your happiness.' The
letter concludes thus: 'I have nothing more to add
but my blessing and best prayers for your health
and prosperity, and to beg you would never forget
you have not upon earth a more disinterested and
warm friend than your truly affectionate father, Geo.
Austen.' We need not be surprised to learn that
this letter was found among the Admiral's private
papers when he died at the age of ninety-one.</p>

<p>The remaining brother, Charles, his sisters' 'own
particular little brother,' born in 1779, must have
been still in the nursery when his sisters left school.</p>

<p>These brothers meant a great deal to Jane<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>; 'but
dearest of all to her heart was her sister Cassandra,
about three years her senior. Their sisterly affection
for each other could scarcely be exceeded. Perhaps
it began on Jane's side with the feeling of deference<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
natural to a loving child towards a kind elder sister.
Something of this feeling always remained; and
even in the maturity of her powers, and in the enjoyment
of increasing success, she would still speak of
Cassandra as of one wiser and better than herself.'
'Their attachment was never interrupted or weakened;
they lived in the same home, and shared the same
bedroom, till separated by death. They were not
exactly alike. Cassandra's was the colder and calmer
disposition; she was always prudent and well-judging,
but with less outward demonstration of feeling
and less sunniness of temper than Jane possessed. It
was remarked in the family that "Cassandra had
the <i>merit</i> of having her temper always under command,
but that Jane had the <i>happiness</i> of a temper
which never required to be commanded."'</p>

<p>Such was the family party at Steventon; and
'there was so much that was agreeable in it that
its members may be excused if they were inclined
to live somewhat too exclusively within it.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> They
might see in each other much to love and esteem,
and something to admire. The family talk had
abundance of spirit and vivacity, and was never
troubled by disagreements even in little matters, for
it was not their habit to dispute or argue with each
other; above all, there was strong family affection
and firm union, never to be broken but by death.
It cannot be doubted that all this had its influence
with the author in the construction of her stories,'
in which family life often plays a large part.</p>

<p>The party which we have described was for many
years 'unbroken<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> by death and seldom visited by
sorrow. Their situation had some peculiar advantages<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
beyond those of ordinary rectories. Steventon was
a family living. Mr. Knight, the patron, was also
proprietor of nearly the whole parish. He never
resided there, and, consequently, the Rector and his
children came to be regarded in the neighbourhood
as representatives of the family. They shared with
the principal tenant the command of an excellent
manor, and enjoyed, in this reflected way, some
of the consideration usually awarded to landed
proprietors. They were not rich, but, aided by
Mr. Austen's power of teaching, they had enough to
afford a good education to their sons and daughters,
to mix in the best society of the neighbourhood, and
to exercise a liberal hospitality to their own relations
and friends.' 'A carriage and pair of horses
were kept'; but this could be done more cheaply
in the eighteenth century than in the nineteenth.
'There were then no assessed taxes; the carriage,
once bought, entailed little further expense; and
the horses, probably, like Mr. Bennet's (in <i>Pride
and Prejudice</i>), were often employed on farm work.
Moreover, it should be remembered that a pair of
horses in those days were almost a necessity, if
ladies were to move about at all; for neither the
condition of the roads nor the style of carriage-building
admitted of any comfortable vehicle being
drawn by a single horse'; indeed, the object of
the builders seems to have been 'to combine the
greatest possible weight with the least possible
amount of accommodation.'<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Jane Austen lost no time in entering on the career
of authorship. She wrote because she must, and
with very little prevision of the path which her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
genius was afterwards to mark out for her. She
was urged onward 'by the first stirrings of talent
within her and the absorbing interest of early
composition.</p>

<p>'It is impossible to say at how early an age she
began. There are copy-books extant containing tales,
some of which must have been composed while she
was a young girl, as they had amounted to a considerable
number by the time she was sixteen. Her
earliest stories are of a slight and flimsy texture, and
are generally intended to be nonsensical, but the
nonsense has much spirit in it. They are usually
preceded by a dedication of mock solemnity to some
one of her family. It would seem that the grandiloquent
dedications prevalent in those days had
not escaped her youthful penetration. Perhaps the
most characteristic feature in those early productions
is that, however puerile the matter, they are
always composed in pure simple English, quite free
from the over-ornamented style which might be
expected from so young a writer.'<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> The following is

</div>


<p>A somewhat later venture, pure extravaganza,
called <i>Evelyn</i> is dedicated, by permission, to Miss
Mary Lloyd.</p>

<p>The manuscript volume which contains <i>Evelyn</i> is
grandly entitled on the outside 'Volume the Third';
on the inside 'Effusions of Fancy by a very Young
Lady, consisting of Tales in a Style entirely new.'
It contains one other tale, unfinished, but of considerable
length, called <i>Kitty or the Bower</i>, which
is preceded by the following dedication, dated
'Steventon, August 1792.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='center'>
<span class="smcap">To Miss Austen.</span>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Madam</span>,&mdash;Encouraged by your warm patronage
of <i>The Beautiful Cassandra</i> and <i>The History of
England</i>, which, through your generous support,
have obtained a place in every library in the Kingdom,
and run through four score editions, I take the liberty
of begging the same Exertions in favour of the
following novel, which I humbly flatter myself
possesses Merit beyond any already published, or any
that will ever in future appear, except such as may
proceed from the pen of your most grateful</p>

<div class='signature'>
Humble Servant,<br />
<span class="smcap">The Author.</span>
</div></div>

<p>The tale begins in characteristic style, which
suggests the later <i>Northanger Abbey</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Catharine had the misfortune, as many heroines
have had before her, of losing her parents when she
was very young, and of being brought up under the
care of a maiden aunt, who, while she tenderly
loved her, watched her conduct with so scrutinizing
a severity as to make it very doubtful to many
people, and to Catharine among the rest, whether
she loved her or not.</p></div>

<p>Catharine lives with this aunt in Devonshire, five
miles from Exeter. Some friends of her aunt, a Mr.
Stanley, M.P., his wife and daughter (very foolish,
and suggestive of Isabella Thorpe) come to visit them.
Mr. Stanley's son turns up unexpectedly and pays
great attention to Catharine, much to the disgust of
the aunt, who has a detestation of all young men.
The tale comes to an abrupt conclusion with the
departure of the guests. The story is at times amusing,
but obviously immature, and we need not regret that
it was never finished.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>Other early sketches are <i>Henry and Eliza</i>,
dedicated to Miss Cooper, which must have been
written before the latter's marriage at the end of
1792; <i>The Visit</i>, dedicated to the Rev. James
Austen; <i>Jack and Alice</i>, and <i>Adventures of Mr.
Harley</i>, dedicated to Francis William Austen, Esq.,
midshipman on board H.M.S. <i>Perseverance</i> (soon
after 1788), and other pieces dedicated to Charles
John Austen, Esq.</p>

<p><i>Evelyn</i> and <i>Kitty</i> seem to mark a second stage
in her literary education: when she was hesitating
between burlesque and immature story-telling, and
when indeed it seemed as if she were first taking note
of all the faults to be avoided, and curiously considering
how she ought <i>not</i> to write before she attempted to
put forth her strength in the right direction.
<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
'Her own mature opinion of the desirableness of
such an early habit of composition is given in the
following words of a niece:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>As I grew older, my aunt would talk to me more
seriously of my reading and my amusements. I
had taken early to writing verses and stories, and
I am sorry to think how I troubled her with reading
them. She was very kind about it, and always
had some praise to bestow, but at last she warned
me against spending too much time upon them.
She said&mdash;how well I recollect it!&mdash;that she knew
writing stories was a great amusement, and <i>she</i>
thought a harmless one, though many people, she
was aware, thought otherwise; but that at my age
it would be bad for me to be much taken up with my
own compositions. Later still&mdash;it was after she had
gone to Winchester&mdash;she sent me a message to this
effect, that if I would take her advice I should cease
writing till I was sixteen; that she had herself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
often wished she had read more, and written less
in the corresponding years of her own life.</p></div>

<p>'As this niece was only twelve years old at the
time of her aunt's death, these words seem to imply
that the juvenile tales which we have mentioned had,
some of them at least, been written in her childhood;
while others were separated only by a very
few years from the period which included specimens
of her most brilliant writing.'</p>

<p>In the summer of 1788, when the girls were fifteen
and twelve respectively, they accompanied their
parents on a visit to their great-uncle, old Mr. Francis
Austen, at Sevenoaks. Though Jane had been to
Oxford, Southampton, and Reading before, it is probable
that this was her first visit into Kent, and, what
must have been more interesting still, her first visit
to London. We have no clue as to where the party
stayed in town, but one of Eliza de Feuillide's letters
to Philadelphia Walter mentions that they dined with
Eliza and her mother on their way back to Hampshire.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>They talked much of the satisfaction their visit
into Kent had afforded them. What did you think
of my uncle's looks? I was much pleased with them,
and if possible he appeared more amiable than
ever to me. What an excellent and pleasing man
he is; I love him most sincerely, as indeed I do all
the family. I believe it was your first acquaintance
with Cassandra and Jane.</p></div>

<p>Though Philadelphia's reply to this letter has
not been preserved, we have a letter of hers to her
brother. Writing on July 23, she says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Yesterday I began an acquaintance with my
two female cousins, Austens. My uncle, aunt,
Cassandra, and Jane arrived at Mr. F. Austen's the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
day before. We dined with them there. As it's pure
nature to love ourselves, I may be allowed to give
the preference to the eldest, who is generally reckoned
a most striking resemblance of me in features, complexion,
and manners. I never found myself so much
disposed to be vain, as I can't help thinking her
very pretty, but fancied I could discover <i>she</i> was not
so well pleased with the comparison, which reflection
abated a great deal of the vanity so likely to arise
and so proper to be suppres't. The youngest [Jane]
is very like her brother Henry, not at all pretty and
very prim, unlike a girl of twelve; but it is hasty
judgment which you will scold me for. My aunt has
lost several fore-teeth, which makes her look old;
my uncle is quite white-haired, but looks vastly
well; all in high spirits and disposed to be pleased
with each other.</p></div>

<p>A day or two later, Philadelphia wrote further:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I continue to admire my amiable likeness the
best of the two in every respect; she keeps up conversation
in a very sensible and pleasing manner.
Yesterday they all spent the day with us, and the
more I see of Cassandra the more I admire [her].
Jane is whimsical and affected.</p></div>

<p>'Not at all pretty,' 'whimsical and affected.'
'Poor Jane!' one is tempted to exclaim, but whatever
she would have said to this estimate of herself,
of one thing we may be perfectly sure: that she
would have been the first to agree with her critic as
to her own absolute inferiority to Cassandra.</p>

<p>There is a passage in a letter written from
Southampton, February 1807,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> in which she says
she is often 'all astonishment and shame' when she
thinks of her own manners as a young girl and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
contrasts them with what she sees in the 'best
children' of a later date.</p>

<p>One other mention of Jane at this period may be
quoted&mdash;that of Sir Egerton Brydges, the author and
genealogist. His sister had married Mr. Lefroy, who
in 1783 had become rector of Ashe (the living which
George Austen would have held, had it become
vacant before Deane), in succession to Dr. Russell.
Sir Egerton, on his marriage in 1788, had for two
years rented Mr. Austen's parsonage at Deane in
order to be near his sister.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The nearest neighbours of the Lefroys were the
Austens at Steventon. I remember Jane Austen
the novelist as a little child. She was very intimate
with Mrs. Lefroy and much encouraged by
her. Her mother was a Miss Leigh, whose paternal
grandmother was sister to the first Duke of Chandos.
Mr. Austen was of a Kentish family, of which several
branches have been settled in the Weald of Kent, and
some are still remaining there. When I knew Jane
Austen I never suspected that she was an authoress,
but my eyes told me that she was fair and handsome,
slight and elegant, but with cheeks a little too full.</p></div>

<p>Sir Egerton's description is the more pleasing of
the two; but it must be remembered that he was
writing long after the time he mentions, and that
his recollections were no doubt somewhat mellowed
by Jane Austen's subsequent fame; whereas Philadelphia
Walter's is an unvarnished contemporary
criticism&mdash;the impression made by Jane on a girl a
few years older than herself.</p>

<p>Fortunately, neither looks nor manners are stereotyped
at the age of twelve, so we need not be surprised
to find that Eliza, when writing in August 1791
in reference to a letter just received from Steventon,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
talks of the two sisters as 'perfect Beauties,' who
were of course gaining 'hearts by dozens.' And
again in November of the same year, she writes that
she hears 'they are two of the prettiest girls in
England.'<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> When due allowance is made for family
exaggeration, we may conclude that at eighteen and
fifteen years of age both Cassandra and Jane had
their fair share of good looks.</p>

<p>Eliza's letters give us another glimpse of the sisters
in 1792, and indeed of the whole Steventon party.
She writes on September 26:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I have the real pleasure of informing you that
our dear Uncle and Aunt are both in perfect
health. The former looks uncommonly well, and
in my opinion his likeness to my beloved mother
is stronger than ever. Often do I sit and trace
her features in his, till my heart overflows at
my eyes. I always tenderly loved my Uncle,
but I think he is now dearer to me than ever, as
being the nearest and best beloved relation of the
never to be sufficiently regretted parent I have
lost; Cassandra and Jane are both very much grown
(the latter is now taller than myself), and greatly
improved as well in manners as in person, both of
which are now much more formed than when you saw
them. They are I think equally sensible and both so
to a degree seldom met with, but still my heart gives
the preference to Jane, whose kind partiality to me
indeed requires a return of the same nature. Henry
is now rather more than six feet high, I believe;
he also is much improved, and is certainly endowed
with uncommon abilities, which indeed seem to have
been bestowed, though in a different way, upon each
member of this family. As to the coolness which
you know had taken place between H. and myself, it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
has now ceased, in consequence of due acknowledgement,
on his part, and we are at present on very
proper relationlike terms. You know that his family
design him for the Church. Cassandra was from
home when I arrived; she was then on a visit to
Rowling, the abode of her brother Edward&mdash;from
which she returned some time since, but is now once
more absent, as well as her sister, on a visit to the
Miss Lloyds, who live at a place called Ibthorp, about
eighteen miles from hence.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There has been a
Club Ball at Basingstoke and a private one in the
neighbourhood, both of which my cousins say were
very agreeable.</p></div>

<p>The date 1790 or 1791 must be assigned to the
portrait&mdash;believed to be of Jane Austen, and believed
to be by Zoffany&mdash;which has been chosen as the
frontispiece for this book, as it was for Lord
Brabourne's edition of the Letters.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> We are unable
for want of evidence to judge of the likeness of
the picture to Jane Austen as a girl; there is, so
far as we have heard, no family tradition of her
having been painted; and, as her subsequent fame
could hardly have been predicted, we should not
expect that either her great-uncle Frank, or her
cousin, Francis Motley Austen, would go to the
expense of a picture of her by Zoffany. Francis
Motley had a daughter of his own, another Jane
Austen, who became Mrs. Campion of Danny, and
a confusion between the two Janes is a possible
explanation.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we believe there is no tradition
in either the Austen or the Campion family of any
such portrait of <i>that</i> Jane Austen, and the <i>provenance</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of our picture is well authenticated. The Rev.
Morland Rice (grandson of Edward Austen) was a
Demy of Magdalen College, Oxford. An old Fellow
of Magdalen, Dr. Newman, many years before his
death, told him that he had a portrait of Jane Austen
the novelist, that had long been in his family. He
stated that it was painted at Bath when she was about
fifteen, and he promised to leave him (M. Rice) the
picture. A few months before his death, Dr. Newman
wrote to his friend, Dr. Bloxam, sending him a picture
as a farewell present, and adding: 'I have another
picture that I wish to go to your neighbour, Morland
Rice. It is a portrait of Jane Austen the novelist, by
Zoffany. The picture was given to my stepmother
by her friend Colonel Austen of Kippington, Kent,
because she was a great admirer of her works.'
Colonel Austen was a son of Francis Motley, and
it is hardly conceivable that he should give away to
a stranger a portrait of his <i>sister</i> Jane as one of his
<i>cousin</i> Jane. Our Jane became fifteen on December 16,
1790, and Zoffany returned from India<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> in that year.
Jane is believed to have visited her uncle, Dr. Cooper
(who died in 1792), at Bath. There is nothing in
these dates to raise any great difficulty, and, on the
whole, we have good reason to hope that we possess
in this picture an authentic portrait of the author.</p>

<p>The Austens seem to have been possessed of considerable
histrionic talent, and they were decidedly
ambitious in the plays they undertook. Their cousin
Eliza was out of England in 1784 when their
theatricals first began; but on a later occasion she
was one of the principal performers. They had their
summer theatre in the barn, and their winter theatre
either there or within the narrow limits of the dining-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>room,
where the number of listeners must have been
very small. In 1784 Sheridan's <i>Rivals</i> was acted
by 'some ladies and gentlemen at Steventon.'
The same year they seem to have given also the
tragedy of <i>Matilda</i>.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> It was the day of prologues
and epilogues, and the young actors were careful to
omit nothing that would make the performance
complete. James, the eldest son, brought into play
his skill in verse-making; and we read of Henry
Austen speaking a prologue (from his brother's
pen) to <i>The Rivals</i>, while the prologue to <i>Matilda</i>
was given by Edward Austen, and the epilogue by
Thomas Fowle.</p>

<p>Midsummer and Christmas were the two seasons
when George Austen dismissed his pupils for their
holidays, and it was at these two periods that the
theatricals usually took place. For the year 1787 we
have a few details as to contemplated performances.
Eliza de Feuillide had come to England with her
mother in the summer of 1786, and probably
went to Steventon at midsummer. In September
1787 she was at Tunbridge Wells with her mother
and her cousin Phila. In a letter to her brother,
Phila tells us that they went to the theatre, where
(as was the custom in those days) the Comtesse&mdash;presumably
as a person of some importance&mdash;'bespoke'
the play, which was <i>Which is the Man?</i><a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
and <i>Bon Ton</i>.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> This is interesting, because later on
in the same letter Phila says: 'They [i.e. the Comtesse
and her mother] go at Christmas to Steventon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
and mean to act a play, <i>Which is the Man?</i> and <i>Bon
Ton</i>. My uncle's barn is fitting up quite like a theatre,
and all the young folks are to take their part. The
Countess is Lady Bob Lardoon [<i>sic</i>] in the former and
Miss Tittup in the latter. They wish me much of the
party and offer to carry me, but I do not think of it.
I should like to be a spectator, but am sure I should not
have courage to act a part, nor do I wish to attain it.'</p>

<p>Eliza was, however, very urgent with Phila that
she should send all diffidence <i>to Coventry</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Your accommodations at Steventon are the only
things my Aunt Austen and myself are uneasy about,
as the house being very full of company, she says she
can only promise you 'a place to hide your head in,'
but I think you will not mind this inconvenience. I
am sure I should not&mdash;to be with you. Do not let
your dress neither disturb you, as I think I can manage
it so that the <i>Green Room</i> should provide you with
what is necessary for acting. We purpose setting
out the 17th of December.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I assure you we shall
have a most brilliant party and a great deal of amusement,
the house full of company, frequent balls. You
cannot possibly resist so many temptations, especially
when I tell you your old friend James is returned from
France and is to be of the acting party.</p></div>

<p>But Phila still stood out, and Eliza attacked her
once more on November 23, begging her to come for
a fortnight to Steventon, provided she could bring
herself to act, 'for my Aunt Austen declares "she
has not room for any <i>idle young people</i>."'</p>

<p>We hear no more news of these theatricals, but
it is probable that there was a change in the selection
of the plays, for there is extant a prologue by
James Austen to <i>The Wonder</i>,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> acted at Steventon,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
December 26 and 28, 1787, as well as an epilogue
'spoken by a Lady in the character of Violante.'
There is also a prologue to <i>The Chances</i>,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> acted at
Steventon, January 1788.</p>

<p>The last Steventon performances of which we
have any knowledge took place in January 1790, when
a farce called <i>The Sultan</i><a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> was acted. The leading
lady on this last occasion was Miss Cooper, who spoke
the epilogue in the character of Roxalana, Henry
Austen playing the title-r&ocirc;le. On the same occasion
Townley's farce, <i>High Life below Stairs</i>, was also
given.</p>

<p>Of Jane's own part in these performances there is
no record, for she was only just fourteen when the last
took place. But even if she took no more share than
Fanny Price, she must have acquired a considerable
acquaintance with the language of the theatre&mdash;knowledge
that she was to turn to good account
in <i>Mansfield Park</i>. She was an early observer, and
it might reasonably be supposed that some of the
incidents and feelings which are so vividly painted
in the <i>Mansfield Park</i> theatricals are due to her
recollections of these entertainments.</p>

<p>The talent and liveliness which she would show,
if ever she had an opportunity of acting herself, may
be imagined. The late Sir William Heathcote is said
to have remembered being with her at a Twelfth
Night party when he was a little boy, on which
occasion she, having drawn the part of Mrs. Candour,
acted it with appreciation and spirit.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>GROWTH AND CHANGE</h3>

<h3>1792-1796</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>Though</span> it may hardly be likely that the Austens
could rival Mrs. Bennet of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> by
professing to dine with four-and-twenty families,
there was, nevertheless (for a quiet country neighbourhood),
a very fair amount of society to be had
around Steventon.</div>

<p>Readers of Jane Austen's letters will come across
the names of many Hampshire neighbours, with
occasional indications of the estimate which she
formed of their intellects and characters. Probably
there were many different degrees of refinement in
different families; and towards the bottom of the list
must have come the squire of many acres,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> who, we are
told, inquired of Mr. Austen whether Paris was in
France or France in Paris, and who quoted a speech
of the Rector's wife as beginning with a round oath,
saying, when remonstrated with, that it was merely
his 'way of telling the story.' When the author of
the <i>Memoir</i> expresses his belief that a century and a
half ago the improvement of manners in most country
parishes began with the clergy, he was no doubt
thinking of the more learned minority of that body,
who would bring into the depths of the country<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
something of the enlightenment of a university. To
this minority Jane's father and brother belonged, and
thus the family probably gave to the society around
them at least as much culture as they received
from it in return.</p>

<p>In the outer circle of their neighbourhood stood
the houses of three peers&mdash;those of Lord Portsmouth
at Hurstbourne, Lord Bolton at Hackwood, and Lord
Dorchester at Greywell. The owners of these places
now and then gave balls at home,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and could also be
relied upon to bring parties to some of the assemblies
at Basingstoke. Hardly less important than these
magnates were the Mildmays of Dogmersfield and the
Chutes of The Vyne. The Mr. Chute of that day was
not only one of the two M.P.'s for the whole county
of Hampshire, but was also a well-known and popular
M.F.H., and the husband of an excellent and
cultivated wife. Then came other squires&mdash;Portals
at Freefolk, Bramstons at Oakley Hall, Jervoises at
Herriard, Harwoods at Deane, Terrys at Dummer,
Holders at Ashe Park&mdash;with several clerical families,
and other smaller folk.</p>

<p>But there were three houses which meant to the
Austen sisters far more than any of the others. The
Miss Biggs<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> of Manydown Park&mdash;a substantial old
manor-house owned by their father, Mr. Bigg Wither,
which stands between Steventon and Basingstoke&mdash;were
especial friends of Cassandra and Jane. One of
these, Elizabeth, became Mrs. Heathcote, and was the
mother of Sir William Heathcote of Hursley Park&mdash;a
fine specimen, morally and intellectually, of a country<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
gentleman, and still remembered by many as Member
for Oxford University, and as <i>sole</i> patron of John Keble.
Catherine, another sister, married Southey's uncle, the
Rev. Herbert Hill; and Alethea, who never married,
was probably for that very reason all the more important
to the Steventon sisters. One of the latest
of Jane's extant letters is addressed to Alethea.</p>

<p>A still closer friendship united Jane and Cassandra
to a family named Lloyd, who for a short time
inhabited their father's second house, the parsonage
at Deane. Mrs. Lloyd had been a Craven&mdash;one of the
unhappy daughters of a beautiful and fashionable but
utterly neglectful mother, who left them to shift for
themselves and to marry where they could. In this
respect Martha Craven had done better than some
of her sisters, having become the wife of a beneficed
clergyman of respectable character and good position.
With him she had led a peaceful life, and, on his death
in January 1789, she spent the first two or three years
of a quiet widowhood at Deane. Her second daughter,
Eliza, was then already married to a first cousin,
Fulwar Craven Fowle; but the two others, Martha
and Mary, were still at home. Both became fast
friends of Cassandra and Jane, and both were
destined eventually to marry into the Austen
family. For the present, their near neighbourhood
came to an end at the beginning of 1792, when
Mrs. Lloyd removed to Ibthorp, eighteen miles
distant from Steventon. It was on the occasion of
this removal that Jane, then just sixteen years old,
presented to Mary Lloyd an interesting specimen
of her own needlework&mdash;still existing. It is a very
small bag, containing a yet smaller rolled-up housewife
furnished with minikin needles and fine thread.
In the housewife is a tiny pocket, and in the pocket is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
enclosed a slip of paper, on which, written as with a
crow-quill, are these lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class='unindent'>It is made of a scrap of old-fashioned gingham,
and, having been carefully preserved, it is in as
perfect a condition as when it was first made a

pen could work as delicately with the needle.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></div>

<p>Martha Lloyd also had her dedicatory poem.
Some years later, when, it seems, she wanted to go
to Harrogate, and hoped in vain for the escort of a
Mr. Best, Jane presented her with a copy of doggerel&mdash;and
probably almost extemporaneous&mdash;verses:&mdash;</p>

</table></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>
<p>We must mention one other intimate friendship&mdash;that
which existed between the Austens
and the Lefroys of Ashe. Mr. Lefroy was Rector
of that parish; and his wife, known within it as
'Madam Lefroy,' was sister to Sir Egerton Brydges
to whom we are indebted for the very early notice
of Jane Austen as a girl which we have already
given.</p>

<p>'Mrs. Lefroy was a remarkable person. Her rare
endowments of goodness, talents, graceful person,
and engaging manners were sufficient to secure her
a prominent place in any society into which she
was thrown; while her enthusiastic eagerness of
disposition rendered her especially attractive to a
clever and lively girl.'<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> How intensely Jane loved and
admired her is shown by some lines which she wrote
on December 16, 1808&mdash;the anniversary both of her
own birth and of the sudden death of her friend,
killed by a fall from her horse in 1804. It has
sometimes been assumed that the self-restraint in
expressions of affection to be found throughout
Jane's published writings, and the self-control they
display in matters of emotion, arises from the fact
that in the writer's nature there were no very ardent
affections to be restrained, and no overpowering
emotions to be suppressed. These lines show the
baselessness of such an assumption. It was not for
the gaze of the public, but to relieve her own heart,
that Jane, at the age of thirty-three, wrote thus,
four years after the death of this elder friend. Here
she dared to speak as she felt, striving in all the
warmth and depth of enduring attachment and
admiration to paint a character which she yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
declares to have been 'past her power to praise.'
The verses continue thus:&mdash;</p>

</table></div>

<p>Time was now to bring changes to the Austens.
The elder brothers married. James had a curacy
at Overton, and near Overton was Laverstoke Manor
House, now occupied by General and Lady Jane
Mathew. James became engaged to their daughter
Anne, five years older than himself. They were
married in March 1792, and started life on an income
of &pound;300 (of which &pound;100 was an allowance made by
General Mathew), keeping, it is said, a small pack
of harriers for the husband, and a close carriage
for the wife. James afterwards moved to Deane,
where he was his father's curate. The married life
of the couple was but short. Their one child, always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
known as Anna, was born in April 1793, and the
mother died suddenly in May 1795, leaving to her
daughter only a shadowy recollection of 'a tall
and slender lady dressed in white.' The poor little
girl fretted in her solitude, till her father took the
wise step of sending her to Steventon Rectory to be
comforted by her aunts. She was admitted to the
chocolate-carpeted dressing-room, which was now
becoming a place of eager authorship. Anna was a
very intelligent, quick-witted child, and, hearing the
original draft of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> read aloud by
its youthful writer to her sister, she caught up the
names of the characters and repeated them so much
downstairs that she had to be checked; for the
composition of the story was still a secret kept from
the knowledge of the elders.</p>

<p>Anna also composed stories herself long before
she could write them down, and preserved a vivid
remembrance of her dear Aunt Jane performing that
task for her, and then telling her others of endless
adventure and fun, which were carried on from day
to day, or from visit to visit.</p>

<p>Towards the end of 1796 James became engaged
to Mary Lloyd, and they were married early in 1797.
The marriage could hardly have happened had not
General Mathew continued, for the sake of Anna, the
&pound;100 a year which he had allowed to his daughter.
The event must have been most welcome to Jane;
and Mrs. Austen wrote a very cheerful and friendly
letter to her daughter-in-law elect, expressing the
'most heartfelt satisfaction at the prospect.' She
adds: 'Had the selection been mine, you, my dear
Mary, are the person I should have chosen for James's
wife, Anna's mother and my daughter, being as
certain as I can be of anything in this uncertain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
world, that you will greatly increase and promote
the happiness of each of the three.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I look
forward to you as a real comfort to me in my old age
when Cassandra is gone into Shropshire,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> and Jane&mdash;the
Lord knows where. Tell Martha she too shall
be my daughter, she does me honour in the request.'
There was an unconscious prophecy contained in
the last words, for Martha became eventually the
second wife of the writer's son Francis.</p>

<p>Edward Austen's marriage had preceded his
brother's by a few months. His kind patrons, the
Knights, would be sure to make this easy for him;
and it must have been under their auspices that he
married (before the end of 1791) Elizabeth, daughter
of Sir Brook Bridges, and was settled at Rowling, a
small house belonging to the Bridges family, about
a mile away from their seat at Goodnestone. No
doubt it was a suitable match; but it must also
have been a marriage of affection, if one may judge
from the happy life which ensued, and from the
lovely features of Mrs. Edward Austen, preserved
in the miniature by Cosway.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Some of Jane's earliest
extant letters were written from Rowling.</p>

<p>The place was not, however, to be the home of
the Edward Austens for long. Mr. Thomas Knight
died in 1794, leaving his large estates to his
widow for her life. Three years later, in 1797, she
determined to make them over, at once, to the
adopted son, who was after her death to become
their owner, retaining for herself only an income of
&pound;2000. On learning her intentions, he sent her a
most grateful and affectionate letter,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> saying that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
wrote because he felt himself incapable of speaking
with her on the subject; that it was impossible for
him and his wife to accede to her plan, for they
should never be happy at Godmersham whilst she
was living in a smaller and less comfortable house,
having quitted a mansion where he had so often
heard her say her whole happiness was centred.
This protest by no means turned Mrs. Knight from
her intentions; on the contrary, she expressed them
still more strongly, and in so charming a spirit that
we must quote a considerable part of her letter:&mdash;</p>




<div class="blockquot"><div class='right'><br />Godmersham Park: Friday.
</div><p>If anything were wanting, my dearest Edward,
to confirm my resolution concerning the plan I
propose executing, your letter would have that
effect; it is impossible for any person to express their
gratitude and affection in terms more pleasing and
gratifying than you have chosen, and from the bottom
of my heart I believe you to be perfectly sincere when
you assure me that your happiness is best secured
by seeing me in the full enjoyment of everything that
can contribute to my ease and comfort, and that
happiness, my dear Edward, will be yours by acceding
to my wishes. From the time that my partiality
for you induced Mr. Knight to treat you as our
adopted child I have felt for you the tenderness of a
mother, and never have you appeared more deserving
of affection than at this time; to reward your merit,
therefore, and to place you in a situation where your
many excellent qualities will be call'd forth and
render'd useful to the neighbourhood is the fondest
wish of my heart. Many circumstances attached to
large landed possessions, highly gratifying to a man,
are entirely lost on me at present; but when I see
you in enjoyment of them, I shall, if possible, feel
my gratitude to my beloved husband redoubled, for
having placed in my hands the power of bestowing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
happiness on one so very dear to me. If my income
had not been sufficient to enable us both to live in
affluence I should never have proposed this plan,
for nothing would have given me more pain than
to have seen a rigid economy take the place of that
liberality which the poor have always experienced
from the family; but with the income I have assigned
you, I trust, my dear Edward, you will feel yourself
rich.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You may assure yourself and my dear
Lizzie, that the pain I shall feel in quitting this
dear place will no longer be remembered when I
see you in possession of it. My attachment to it can,
I think, only cease with my life; but if I am near
enough to be your frequent daily visitor and within
reach of the sight of you and your boys and Lizzie
and her girls, I trust I shall be as happy, perhaps
happier, than I am now.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">Your most sincere friend,</span><br />

<p>Meanwhile, Francis Austen had made a good
start in his profession. Going out to the East Indies,
according to the custom of those days as a 'volunteer,'
he became a midshipman, but remained one for four
years only. Promotion&mdash;'that long thought of,
dearly earned, and justly valued blessing'&mdash;was
bestowed upon him two years sooner than it fell to
the lot of William Price in <i>Mansfield Park</i>, and he
became a lieutenant at the age of seventeen&mdash;a
sufficient testimony to that steadiness of character
which distinguished him throughout the course of a
very long life. As lieutenant he remained another
year in the East Indies, and then returned to serve
on the Home Station. The result of this last move
was that in 1793, rather more than a year after the
marriages of James and Edward, their parents had
the delight of welcoming back a son, who, having
quitted them as a boy not yet fifteen years old,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
reappeared as a young man and successful officer, of
whom his family might be justly proud.</p>

<p>Other events, grave and gay, were now happening
at Steventon. Besides Eliza de Feuillide, who took
refuge there with her young son while the clouds
were gathering round her husband in France, the
rectory had another visitor in the summer of 1792,
in Jane Cooper, daughter of Mrs. Austen's only
sister, who came here after her father's death. Dr.
Cooper had set out in June with his son and daughter,
and his neighbours, the Lybbe Powyses, on a tour
to the Isle of Wight. The tour had important results
for the young Coopers, as Edward became engaged
to Caroline Lybbe Powys, and his sister to Captain
Thomas Williams, R.N., whom she met at Ryde.
Dr. Cooper, whose health had been the chief reason
for the tour, did not long survive his return, dying
at Sonning (of which he had been vicar since 1784)
on August 27. The date of his daughter's wedding
was already fixed, but had of course to be postponed.
She went immediately to Steventon, and was married
from the Rectory on December 11 of the same year.
One happy result of this marriage was to provide an
opening for the naval career of the youngest of the
Austens, Charles, who was three years younger
than Jane, and whom we last met in the nursery.
As he was also five years junior to Francis, the latter
must have quitted the Naval Academy some time
before his brother entered it. Charles Austen was one
of those happy mortals destined to be loved from
childhood to old age by every one with whom they
come in contact. How great a favourite he was at
home is easily to be read between the lines of his
sister's letters; and when he died at the age of
seventy-three as Admiral of the British Fleet in the
Burmese waters, one who was with him wrote that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
'his death was a great grief to the whole fleet&mdash;I
know I cried bitterly when I found he was dead.'
The charming expression of countenance in the
miniatures still existing of this youngest brother
makes such feelings quite comprehensible.</p>

<p>On leaving the Academy he served under his
cousin's husband, Captain Thomas Williams, and
was fortunate enough to witness and take part in
a most gallant action when, in June 1796, Captain
Williams's frigate, the <i>Unicorn</i>, gave chase to a
French frigate, <i>La Tribune</i>, and, after a run of two
hundred and ten miles, succeeded in capturing her.
To Charles, at the age of seventeen, this must have
been a very exciting experience; while to Captain
Williams it brought the honour of knighthood.</p>

<p>What with their visitors and their dances, and
with a wedding to prepare for, life must have been
gay enough for the Miss Austens during the autumn
of 1792. Cassandra and Jane were now of an age
to enjoy as much dancing as they could get: in fact,
if Jane began dancing as early as she made Lydia
Bennet begin, she may already have been going for
a year or two to the monthly assemblies that Basingstoke
(like every other town of any size) boasted of
during the winter months.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we know very little of Jane's
personal history from 1792 to 1796. Most of her
time would naturally be spent at home; but we catch
an occasional glimpse of her, now dancing at Southampton,
now travelling with Cassandra one hot
summer's day from London to stay with her brother
Edward at Rowling (in 1794), now visiting in
Gloucestershire.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>
<p>Early in 1794 came the shock of the execution of
the Comte de Feuillide; and Eliza, widowed and
motherless, and with an invalid boy, must have
become more of a serious care to her relations. Over
the acquittal of her benefactor and godfather,
Warren Hastings, there was but one feeling in the
family. They all admired him as a high-minded
patriot, a warm and disinterested friend, and a
scholar whose approbation was an honour. The event
inspired Henry Austen with more than his usual
grandeur of language. 'Permit me,' he says (writing
to Hastings) 'to congratulate my country and myself
as an Englishman; for right dear to every Englishman
must it be to behold the issue of a combat where
forms of judicature threatened to annihilate the
essence of justice.'</p>

<p>One event of the deepest interest occurred during
this period&mdash;namely, Cassandra's engagement to
Thomas Fowle (brother of Eliza Lloyd's husband),
which probably took place in 1795 when she was
twenty-three years old. She had known him from
childhood, as he was a pupil at Steventon Rectory in
1779. Mr. Fowle had taken Orders, and was at this
time Rector of Allington in Wiltshire. An immediate
marriage did not seem prudent, but advancement
was hoped for from his kinsman, Lord Craven;
and, as one of the livings in his gift was Ryton in
Shropshire, it must have been to this place that
Mrs. Austen alluded as the future home of Cassandra
in the letter to her intended daughter-in-law, Mary
Lloyd. At present, however, Lord Craven could
only show his interest in Mr. Fowle by taking him
out with him to the West Indies as chaplain to his
own regiment.</p>

<p>Jane's literary projects were now assuming a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
more definite shape, although the process of selection
and elimination both in subjects and method was not
yet finished. To this period belongs <i>Elinor and
Marianne</i>, a first sketch for <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>,
but written in letters. We know that it was read
aloud, but no details have come down to us, and it
is difficult to guess between whom the letters can
have passed, for in the novel Elinor and Marianne
are never parted, even for a single day. It seems
therefore as if the alterations subsequently made
must have been radical; and the difficulty and
labour which such a complete transformation would
involve make the author's unfavourable judgment on
her own earlier method of writing all the stronger.
If she decided against using letters as a vehicle for
story-telling in the future, it seems all the more
probable that the only other instance of her use of
this style was at least as early as the date we have
now reached.</p>

<p>The author of the <i>Memoir</i> yielded with reluctance
to many solicitations asking him to include <i>Lady
Susan</i> in his second edition;<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> while he himself
agreed with other critics that the work was 'scarcely
one on which a literary reputation could be founded.'
As a stage in the development of the author it has
great interest. Strictly speaking, it is not a story
but a study. There is hardly any attempt at a plot,
or at the grouping of various characters; such as
exist are kept in the background, and serve chiefly
to bring into bolder relief the one full-length, highly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
finished, wholly sinister figure which occupies the
canvas, but which seems, with the completion of
the study, to have disappeared entirely from the
mind of its creator. It is equally remarkable that
an inexperienced girl should have had independence
and boldness enough to draw at full length a woman
of the type of Lady Susan, and that, after she had
done so, the purity of her imagination and the
delicacy of her taste should have prevented her
from ever repeating the experiment.</p>

<p>But if Jane Austen never again wrote a story in
letters, no one was ever more successful in using them
for exhibitions of character. The letters of Lucy
Steele, Mr. Collins, Isabella Thorpe, Lady Bertram,
and Mary Musgrove are all masterpieces of unconscious
humour&mdash;and some of the more serious letters
are not far behind them.</p>

<p>The extant letters of Jane herself begin in 1796,
and will accompany us through the rest of the story.
They are far the most important additions that can
be made to the short history contained in the <i>Memoir;</i>
and the little notices which we have given&mdash;it may
have seemed with needless particularity&mdash;of her
relations and neighbours have been given partly
in order to enable the readers of her letters to follow
the numerous personal allusions to be found in them.
We must not, however, try to extract more out of the
letters than they will yield. The bulk of them belong
to the collection published by Lord Brabourne, and
nearly the whole of this collection consists of letters
from Jane to Cassandra. But the normal condition
of the sisters' lives was to be together&mdash;residing in
one house, sleeping in one room. We can therefore
only learn from this source what happened on the
comparatively rare occasions when they were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
separated. Nor is this all, for a good deal of their
correspondence is missing. Some of it is probably lost
by accident; a great deal was certainly destroyed by
Cassandra of set purpose. The Austens had a great
hatred and dread of publicity. Cassandra felt this
with especial force, and the memory of Jane was to
her so sacred that to allow the gaze of strangers to
dwell upon the actions or the feelings of so precious
a being would have seemed to her nothing short of
profanation. In her old age she became aware that
Jane's fame had not only survived but increased,
and that a time might come when the public would
wish to know more details of her life than had
been given in the short memoir, written by Henry
Austen, and prefixed to her posthumous works.
Cassandra would not indeed be likely to think it
possible that the letters themselves should be published,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
but they might be made use of as materials,
and so she determined to do what must have been
a great sacrifice, and burn all those which were
specially dear to herself, feeling confident that the
remainder would not be disturbed. The destroyed
MSS. without doubt included much that would have
been of particular value to the biographer.</p>

<p>We must also remember that the correspondence
was between sisters who knew, each of them, what the
other was thinking, and could feel sure that nothing
one might say would be misapprehended by the other;
and the sort of freemasonry which results from such
a situation adds to the difficulty of perfect com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>prehension
by outsiders. Jane, too, was a mistress
of subtle irony: the inveterate playfulness which is
constantly cropping up in her books appears also in
her letters. Secure of her correspondent, she could
pass criticisms, impute motives, and imagine circumstances
which would have been very far from her
nature had she thought it possible that any less
perfectly informed third person could see them.</p>

<p>All our authorities agree in describing her as one
of the most considerate and least censorious of
mortals. 'She was singularly free,' says one of her
nieces, 'from the habit .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of looking out for
people's foibles for her own amusement, or the entertainment
of her hearers.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I do not suppose she
ever in her life said a sharp thing.' We may be
sure, therefore, that when she seems to imply that
her mother's ailments were imaginary, or that Mrs.
Knight's generosity to Edward was insignificant, or
that Mrs. Knight herself was about to contract a
second marriage, she is no more serious than when
she describes herself as having taken too much wine,
as a hardened flirt, or as a selfish housekeeper ordering
only those things which she herself preferred.</p>

<p>We must therefore take the letters as they are,
without expecting to find any expression of views
on such important subjects as religion, politics, or
literature&mdash;subjects which might better be discussed
in conversation with Cassandra; and with these
limitations in our minds we shall probably agree
with Mr. A. C. Bradley,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> who does not find the
letters disappointing because 'the Jane Austen who
wrote the novels is in them.'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>ROMANCE</h3>

<h3>1795-1802</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>Miss Mitford</span>, in a paragraph showing some hostility
to Jane Austen, tells us that her own mother spent
her maiden life in the neighbourhood of the Austens
and knew Jane as 'the prettiest, silliest, most affected,
husband-hunting butterfly she ever remembers.'
It is perhaps a sufficient answer to this attack if we
remark that when Mrs. Mitford married and left her
home Jane was barely ten years old, and that at a
date two years later she was accused by a cousin of
being 'prim.' It is probable that on growing up
she, like other girls, enjoyed admiration, and it is
certain that she attracted a good deal of it;
but she says so much to her elder sister and mentor
about one particular flirtation that we may be
sure that it was neither a serious nor a frequent
occupation with her.</div>

<p>In a letter<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> written from Steventon, November 17,
1798, she mentions a visit from her friend Mrs. Lefroy,
and adds that she had enough private conversation
with her to hear all that was interesting,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">which you will easily credit when I tell you that of
her nephew she said nothing at all, and of her friend
very little. She did not once mention the name of
the former to <i>me</i>, and I was too proud to make any
enquiries; but on my father's afterwards asking
where he was, I learnt that he was gone back to
London in his way to Ireland, where he is called
to the Bar and means to practise.<br />

<p>She showed me a letter which she had received
from her friend a few weeks ago (in answer to
one written by her to recommend a nephew of
Mrs. Russell to his notice at Cambridge) towards
the end of which was a sentence to this effect: 'I
am very sorry to hear of Mrs. Austen's illness. It
would give me particular pleasure to have an opportunity
of improving my acquaintance with that
family with a hope of creating to myself a nearer
interest. But at present I cannot indulge any
expectation of it.' This is rational enough; there
is less love and more sense in it than sometimes
appeared before, and I am very well satisfied. It
will all go on exceedingly well, and decline away in a
very reasonable manner. There seems no likelihood
of his coming into Hampshire this Christmas, and
it is therefore most probable that our indifference
will soon be mutual, unless his regard, which appeared
to spring from knowing nothing of me at first, is
best supported by never seeing me.</p></div>

<p>Mrs. Lefroy's 'friend,' though Jane was interested
to hear of him, had evidently not touched her heart,
and we should know nothing more of him if it were
not for a letter of hers to her brother Frank, written
more than fourteen years afterwards, and published
in the <i>Sailor Brothers</i>.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I wonder whether you happened to see Mr.
Blackall's marriage in the papers last January. We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
did. He was married at Clifton to a Miss Lewis, whose
father had been late of Antigua. I should very much
like to know what sort of a woman she is. He was a
piece of perfection&mdash;noisy perfection&mdash;himself, which
I always recollect with regard. We had noticed a
few months before his succeeding to a College living,
the very living which we recollected his talking of,
and wishing for; an exceeding good one, Great<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
Cadbury in Somersetshire. I could wish Miss Lewis
to be of a silent turn and rather ignorant, but
naturally intelligent and wishing to learn, fond of cold
veal pies, green tea in the afternoon, and a green
window-blind at night.</p></div>

<p>North Cadbury is an Emmanuel College living,
and Mr. Blackall was a Fellow of that society, who,
after the fashion of the times, had waited long for his
living and his wife. Jane had known him well and
liked him much, though with sufficient detachment
to remember and to criticise his demonstrative
manners, his love of instructing others, and other
little peculiarities. The 'friend' of 1798 must have
been a young Cambridge don; and she was not likely
to have had an opportunity of knowing individually
more than one of that limited community, who did
not naturally come in the Austens' way. It seems
obvious to link the two allusions together; and if
this is correct, we have identified one of the admirers
of our heroine.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p><p>More serious&mdash;but not <i>very</i> serious&mdash;was the
attachment between her and Mrs. Lefroy's nephew,
Tom Lefroy, afterwards Chief Justice of Ireland, which
is mentioned somewhat cautiously in the <i>Memoir</i>, and
the end of which is alluded to in the letter already
quoted.</p>

<p>The young people became acquainted in the
winter of 1795-6, and took to each other from the first.
In a lively letter to Cassandra on January 9, 1796,
Jane describes a ball at Manydown:&mdash;</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p>Mr. H[eathcote]<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> began with Elizabeth, and afterwards
danced with her again; but <i>they</i> do not know
how <i>to be particular</i>. I flatter myself, however, that
they will profit by the three successive lessons which
I have given them.</p>

<p>You scold me so much in the nice long letter
which I have this moment received from you, that
I am almost afraid to tell you how my Irish friend and
I behaved. Imagine to yourself everything most
profligate and shocking in the way of dancing and
sitting down together. I <i>can</i> expose myself, however,
only <i>once more</i>, because he leaves the country soon
after next Friday, on which day we <i>are</i> to have a
dance at Ashe after all. He is a very gentlemanlike,
good-looking, pleasant young man, I assure you.
But as to our having ever met, except at the three
last balls, I cannot say much; for he is so excessively
laughed at about me at Ashe, that he is ashamed of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
coming to Steventon, and ran away when we called
on Mrs. Lefroy a few days ago.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. After I had
written the above, we received a visit from Mr. Tom
Lefroy and his cousin George. The latter is really
very well-behaved now; and as to the other, he has
but <i>one</i> fault, which time will I trust entirely remove;
it is that his morning coat is a great deal too light.
He is a very great admirer of Tom Jones, and therefore
wears the same coloured clothes, I imagine, which
<i>he</i> did when he was wounded.</p></div>

<p>A few days later she is writing again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Our party to Ashe to-morrow night will consist
of Edward Cooper, James (for a ball is nothing without
<i>him</i>), Buller, who is now staying with us, and I.
I look forward with great impatience to it, as I rather
expect to receive an offer from my friend in the
course of the evening. I shall refuse him, however,
unless he promises to give away his white coat.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;At length the day is come on which
I am to flirt my last with Tom Lefroy, and when you
receive this it will be over. My tears flow as I write
at the melancholy idea.</p></div>

<p>Truly the 'prim' little girl of twelve had made
considerable progress by the time she was twenty!
Unfortunately, there is no further letter to tell us
whether Tom made the expected proposal or not;
but it is pretty certain that he did not, and indeed
there is a good deal of doubt whether it was really
expected. Possibly lack of means prevented its ever
being a serious matter on his side. They can never
have met again on the same intimate terms. If he
visited Ashe at all in 1798, the conditions must have
been different, for he was by that time tacitly engaged
to the lady whom he married in March 1799.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Tom Lefroy accordingly disappears from Jane's life,
though he never forgot her till his death at the age
of ninety. When he was an old man he told a young
relation that 'he had been in love with Jane Austen,
but it was a boy's love.'</p>

<p>As for Jane's feelings, the opinion in the family
seems to have been that it was a disappointment, but
not a severe one. Had it been severe, either Jane
would not have joked about it, or Cassandra would
have destroyed the letters.</p>

<p>But the day of Jane's one real romance was still
to come: a romance which probably affected the flow
of her spirits, and helped to disincline her for literary
composition, for some time after its occurrence.
In this case, as in the other, the author of the <i>Memoir</i>
was rather reticent; but shortly after its publication
his sister, Caroline Austen, was induced to put down
in writing the facts as she knew them. No one could
be better qualified to do this, for she was a person of
great ability, and endowed with a wonderfully accurate
and retentive memory. It will be seen also that she
has the unimpeachable authority of Cassandra to
support her; we can therefore feel confidence in the
truth of the story, although date, place, and even the
name<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> of the gentleman are missing.</p>

<p>Caroline Austen's account is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>All that I know is this. At Newtown, Aunt
Cassandra was staying with us [i.e. with the writer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and her mother, Mrs. James Austen] when we made
acquaintance with a certain Mr. H. E., of the Engineers.
He was very pleasing and very good-looking. My
aunt was very much struck with him, and <i>I</i> was
struck by her commendation; she so rarely admired
strangers. Afterwards, at another time&mdash;I do not
remember exactly when&mdash;she spoke of him as of one
so unusually gifted with all that was agreeable, and
said that he reminded her strongly of a gentleman
whom they had met one summer when they were by
the sea&mdash;I think she said in Devonshire; I don't
think she named the place, and I am sure she did not
say Lyme, for that I should have remembered&mdash;that
he seemed greatly attracted by my Aunt Jane&mdash;I
suppose it was an intercourse of some weeks&mdash;and
that when they had to part (I imagine he was a
visitor also, but his family might have lived near)
he was urgent to know where they would be the next
summer, implying or perhaps saying that he should
be there also, wherever it might be. I can only say
that the impression left on Aunt Cassandra was that
he had fallen in love with her sister, and was quite
in earnest. Soon afterwards they heard of his death.
Mr. H. E. also died of a sudden illness soon after we
had seen him at Newtown, and I suppose it was that
coincidence of early death that led my aunt to speak
of him&mdash;the unknown&mdash;at all. I am sure she thought
he was worthy of her sister, from the way in which
she recalled his memory, and also that she did not
doubt, either, that he would have been a successful
suitor.</p></div>

<p>This short history contains all the facts that are
known. The rest must be left to imagination; but
of two things we may be sure: the man whom
Cassandra deemed worthy of her sister can have
been no ordinary person, and the similarity in the
ending of romance in the case of both sisters must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
have added a strong link of sympathy to the chain
of love which bound their lives together.</p>

<p>A story is given in the <i>Reminiscences of Sir
Francis H. Doyle</i>, to the effect that Mr. Austen,
accompanied by Cassandra and Jane, took advantage
of the Peace of Amiens, in 1802, to undertake a foreign
tour. Whilst in Switzerland, they fell in with a young
naval officer, who speedily became attached to Jane.
His love was returned, and all seemed to be going
smoothly. The party were making for Chamonix;
but while the Austens kept to such high road as there
was, their friend was to make his way thither over
the mountains. The Austens reached Chamonix
safely, but their friend never arrived, and at last
news came that he had over-tired himself and died
of brain fever on the way. The Austens returned to
England, and Jane resumed her ordinary life, never
referring to her adventures abroad. This story is
given on the authority of a Miss Ursula Mayow,
who heard it thirty or forty years later from a niece
of Jane Austen's. Who this niece was we do not
know, but she cannot have been either of the two
who were grown up before their aunt's death, for they
knew nothing of any such journey. As it stands,
the story is impossible for many reasons. We give
three:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Such an important and unusual event as a
tour in Switzerland could not have taken place
without leaving traces behind, and there is no shadow
of a tradition of it remaining in the family.</p>

<p>2. They could not possibly have afforded it.
George Austen had given up his living, and was
hoping to have &pound;600 a year as a maximum for the
family party of four persons, and they had just had
the expense of setting up house in Bath.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>3. We can almost prove an alibi. We know that
they were at Dawlish in the year of the Peace of
Amiens, and they certainly could not have made
another lengthened absence.</p>

<p>The story, however, is interesting, for it fits in
(so far as its main theme is concerned) with the
authentic account given above of Jane's romance in
the west, although the setting is completely different.
It is quite possible that the fiction originated in
an incorrect account&mdash;mis-heard or mis-repeated&mdash;of
the true tale, mixed up with the fact (mentioned
below) that the Henry Austens went abroad at this
time.</p>

<p>One more incident shall be narrated: an incident
which, though full of discomfort and inconvenience
for the actors, yet lacks the note of tragedy contained
in the last. It rests on the same excellent authority,
with the additional safeguard that Caroline Austen's
own mother must have known the circumstances
exactly. The story is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>In November 1802 Cassandra and Jane came from
Bath to pay a visit to their old home&mdash;then in the
possession of their eldest brother James and his wife
Mary. In the course of it, they went to spend a few
days with some old friends in the neighbourhood. On
the morning of Friday, December 3, they suddenly
reappeared&mdash;their friends having driven them back&mdash;at
an unlooked-for moment. All got out, and to Mrs.
James Austen's surprise a tender scene of embraces
and tears and distressing farewells took place in the
hall. No sooner had the carriage disappeared than
Cassandra and Jane, without offering any explanation,
turned to her and said that they must at once
go back to Bath&mdash;the very next day&mdash;it was absolutely
necessary, and (as an escort for young ladies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
travelling by coach was also necessary) their brother
James must take them&mdash;although Saturday was a
day on which it was most inconvenient for a single-handed
rector to go far from his parish; for he could
not return till Monday, and there was hardly any time
to provide for his Sunday duty. But Cassandra and
Jane, in a manner very unlike their usual considerate
selves, refused to remain till Monday, nor would they
give any reason for this refusal. James was therefore
obliged to yield and to go with them to Bath. In
course of time the mystery was solved. One<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> of the
family with whom they had been staying had made
Jane an offer of marriage, which she accepted&mdash;only
to repent of her action deeply before many
hours had passed. Her niece Caroline's remarks are
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I conjecture that the advantages he could offer,
and her gratitude for his love, and her long friendship
with his family, induced my aunt to decide that she
would marry him when he should ask her, but that
having accepted him she found she was miserable.
To be sure, she should not have said 'Yes' overnight;
but I have always respected her for her courage
in cancelling that 'Yes' the next morning; all
worldly advantages would have been to her, and she
was of an age to know this quite well (she was nearly
twenty-seven). My aunts had very small fortunes;
and on their father's death, they and their mother
would be, they were aware, but poorly off. I believe
most young women so circumstanced would have
gone on trusting to love after marriage.</p></div>

<p>If this event occurred after the more romantic
incident in the west of England it is possible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
that Jane had hardly as yet regained her wonted
balance of mind and calmness of judgment. We
have no further tale of the sort to tell. As time
went on, she acquiesced cheerfully in the gradual
disappearance of youth. She did not eschew balls,
but was indifferent whether she was asked to dance or
not: 'It was the same room in which we danced
fifteen years ago; I thought it all over, and in spite
of the shame of being so much older, felt with thankfulness
that I was quite as happy now as then.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
You will not expect to hear that <i>I</i> was asked to
dance, but I was.'</p>

<p>She was to spend the remainder of her life
in the centre of family interests, and by degrees
to become engrossed in the exciting business of
authorship. She could afford to laugh at the suggestion
that she should marry the Rector of Chawton,
and promise to do so, whatever his reluctance or
her own. She retained to the end her freshness and
humour, her sympathy with the young: '<i>We</i> do not
grow older, of course,' she says in one of her latest
letters; and it is evident that this was the impression
left with the rising generation of nephews and nieces
from their intercourse with her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>AUTHORSHIP AND CORRESPONDENCE</h3>

<h3>1796-1798</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>The</span> appearance of Jane Austen's name among the
list of subscribers to Madame d'Arblay's <i>Camilla</i>,
in 1796, marks the beginning of her literary career.
Her father must have paid the necessary subscription
for her: and he probably did so believing that his
daughter's talent deserved encouragement. Jane's
cousins, the Cookes of Bookham, were some of
Madame d'Arblay's closest friends while the latter was
living in that neighbourhood, from 1793 to 1797, and
it is quite likely that they were active in getting
subscribers. One likes to think that&mdash;as Miss Hill
has suggested<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>&mdash;Jane may have met Madame d'Arblay
when paying a visit to Bookham.</div>

<p>Jane was destined to have two periods of active
authorship: periods of unequal length, and divided
from each other by eight or ten nearly barren years.
This unfruitful time has been accounted for in several
different ways: as arising from personal griefs,
literary disappointment, or want of a settled home.
These disturbing causes all existed, and it is probable
that each contributed its share to her unwillingness
to write; but at present she enjoyed hope and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
happiness, the vigour and cheerfulness of youth among
congenial companions, and a home as yet unvisited
by any acute sorrows.</p>

<p>No precise date has been assigned to the writing
of <i>Elinor and Marianne;</i> but after the completion
of that sketch her time has been fully mapped out<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>First Impressions</i> (original of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>),
begun October 1796, ended August 1797.</p>

<p><i>Sense and Sensibility</i>, begun November 1797.</p>

<p><i>Northanger Abbey</i> (probably called <i>Susan</i>), written
in 1797 and 1798.</p>

<p>It has been usual to dwell on the precocity of
intellect shown in the composition of the first two of
these works by a young and inexperienced girl, and
no doubt there is much justice in the observation;
but we venture to think that it is in <i>Northanger
Abbey</i> that we get the best example of what she
could produce at the age of three- or four-and-twenty.
In the two others, the revision they underwent before
publication was so complete that it is impossible now
to separate the earlier from the later work; whereas
in <i>Northanger Abbey</i>, while there is good evidence
from the author's preface of a careful preparation
for the press before she sold it in 1803, there is no
mention of any radical alteration at a subsequent
date. On the contrary, she apologises for what may
seem old-fashioned in the social arrangements of the
story by alleging the length of time that had elapsed
since its completion. There is internal evidence to the
same effect: she has not quite shaken off the tendency
to satirise contemporary extravagances; and it
is not until several chapters are past that she settles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
herself down to any serious creation of characters.
The superiority also in interest and fun of the first
volume over the second, though no doubt inherent
in the scheme of the story, is a defect which she would
hardly have tolerated at a later date. Nevertheless,
we think her admirers may be satisfied with this
example of her youthful style. The charm with
which she manages to invest a simple ingenuous girl
like Catherine, the brightness of Henry Tilney&mdash;even
the shallowness of Isabella and the boorishness of
John Thorpe&mdash;are things we part from with regret.
And in parting with our friends at the end of one of
her novels, we part with them for good and all;
they never re-appear in another shape elsewhere;
even Mrs. Allen and Lady Bertram are by no means
the same.</p>

<p>It seems to have been only a happy accident
(though no doubt an accident very likely to occur)
which prevented <i>First Impressions</i> from appearing
in its immature shape.</p>

<p>George Austen was ready, and indeed anxious,
that his daughter's work should be published; and
when she had finished the story in August 1797, he
took steps to find a publisher. Years afterwards (probably
in 1836), at the sale of the effects of Mr. Cadell,
the famous London publisher, the following letter
was purchased by a connexion of the family:&mdash;</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have in my possession a manuscript
novel, comprising 3 vols., about the length of Miss
Burney's <i>Evelina</i>. As I am well aware of what
consequence it is that a work of this sort sh<sup>d.</sup> make
its first appearance under a respectable name, I
apply to you. I shall be much obliged, therefore,
if you will inform me whether you choose to be
concerned in it, what will be the expense of publishing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
it at the author's risk, and what you will venture
to advance for the property of it, if on perusal it is
approved of. Should you give any encouragement,
I will send you the work.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">I am, Sir, your humble servant,</span><br />

<span class="smcap">George Austen.</span>
</div>


<p>Steventon, near Overton, Hants.:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">November 1, 1797.</span>
</p></div>

<p>This proposal, we are told, was declined by return
of post.</p>

<p>The earliest of Jane's letters which have survived
date from the year 1796. They begin at Steventon
in the middle of their winter engagements, and when
Tom Lefroy was in the foreground.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>




<div class="blockquot"><div class='right'><br />Steventon: Saturday [January 9, 1796].
</div><p>In the first place, I hope you will live twenty-three
years longer. Mr. Tom Lefroy's birthday was
yesterday, so that you are very near of an age.</p>

<p>After this necessary preamble I shall proceed to
inform you that we had an exceeding good ball
last night, and that I was very much disappointed
at not seeing Charles Fowle of the party, as I had
previously heard of his being invited.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>We were so terrible good as to take James in our
carriage, though there were three of us before; but
indeed he deserves encouragement for the very great
improvement which has lately taken place in his
dancing. Miss Heathcote is pretty, but not near so
handsome as I expected.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Henry is still hankering after the Regulars, and
as his project of purchasing the adjutancy of the
Oxfordshire is now over, he has got a scheme in his
head about getting a lieutenancy and adjutancy in
the 86th, a new-raised regiment, which he fancies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
will be ordered to the Cape of Good Hope. I heartily
hope that he will, as usual, be disappointed in this
scheme.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Steventon: Thursday [January 14, 1796].
</div>

<p>I am very much flattered by your commendation
of my last letter, for I write only for fame, and
without any view to pecuniary emolument.</p>

<p>Tell Mary<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> that I make over Mr. Heartley and
all his estate to her for her sole use and benefit in
future, and not only him, but all my other admirers
into the bargain wherever she can find them, even
the kiss which C. Powlett wanted to give me, as I
mean to confine myself in future to Mr. Tom Lefroy,
for whom I don't care sixpence. Assure her also as
a last and indubitable proof of Warren's indifference
to me, that he actually drew that gentleman's picture
for me, and delivered it to me without a sigh.</p></div>

<p>The next batch of letters date from a visit paid
by Jane, in August 1796, to Rowling, the Kent
home of her brother Edward. She seems to have
experienced a difficulty in finding an escort for her
return journey. Henry kept changing his plans;
and Frank, the sailor, was liable to be sent for at
a day's notice. She had evidently been studying
her copy of <i>Camilla</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'>Cork Street: Tuesday morn [August 1796].
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cassandra</span>,&mdash;Here I am once more in
this scene of dissipation and vice, and I begin already
to find my morals corrupted. We reached Staines
yesterday, I do not [know] when, without suffering
so much from the heat as I had hoped to do. We
set off again this morning at seven o'clock, and had
a very pleasant drive, as the morning was cloudy
and perfectly cool. I came all the way in the chaise
from Hartford Bridge.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>
<p>Edward and Frank are both gone out to seek
their fortunes; the latter is to return soon and help
us seek ours. The former we shall never see again.
We are to be at Astley's to-night, which I am glad of.
Edward has heard from Henry this morning. He has
not been at the races at all, unless his driving Miss
Pearson over to Rowling one day can be so called.
We shall find him there on Thursday.</p>

<p>I hope you are all alive after our melancholy
parting yesterday, and that you pursued your intended
avocation with success. God bless you! I must
leave off, for we are going out.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">Yours very affectionately,</span><br />

<span class="smcap">J. Austen.</span>
</div>

<p>Everybody's love.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Rowling: Thursday [September 1, 1796].
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dearest Cassandra</span>,&mdash;The letter which I
have this moment received from you has diverted me
beyond moderation. I could die of laughter at it,
as they used to say at school. You are indeed the
finest comic writer of the present age.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I am sorry that you found such a conciseness in
the strains of my first letter. I must endeavour
to make you amends for it, when we meet, by
some elaborate details, which I shall shortly begin
composing.</p>

<p>Our men had but indifferent weather for their
visit to Godmersham, for it rained great part of the
way there and all the way back. They found Mrs.
Knight remarkably well and in very good spirits.
It is imagined that she will shortly be married again.
I have taken little George once in my arms since
I have been here, which I thought very kind.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>To-morrow I shall be just like Camilla in Mr.
Dubster's summer-house; for my Lionel will have
taken away the ladder by which I came here, or at
least by which I intended to get away, and here I
must stay till his return. My situation, however, is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
somewhat preferable to hers, for I am very happy
here, though I should be glad to get home by the end
of the month. I have no idea that Miss Pearson
will return with me.</p>

<p>What a fine fellow Charles is, to deceive us into
writing two letters to him at Cork! I admire his
ingenuity extremely, especially as he is so great a
gainer by it.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I am glad to hear so good an account of Mr.
Charde, and only fear that my long absence may
occasion his relapse. I practise every day as much
as I can&mdash;I wish it were more for his sake.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Frank has turned a very nice little butter-churn for
Fanny. I do not believe that any of the party were
aware of the valuables they had left behind; nor
can I hear anything of Anna's gloves. Indeed I have
not enquired at all about them hitherto.</p>

<p>We are very busy making Edward's shirts, and I am
proud to say that I am the neatest worker of the party.</p>


<div class='right'>Rowling: Monday [September 5, 1796].
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cassandra</span>,&mdash;I shall be extremely
anxious to hear the event of your ball, and shall hope
to receive so long and minute an account of every
particular that I shall be tired of reading it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I hope John Lovett's accident will not prevent his
attending the ball, as you will otherwise be obliged
to dance with Mr. Tincton the whole evening. Let
me know how J. Harwood deports himself without
the Miss Biggs, and which of the Marys will carry
the day with my brother James.</p>

<p><i>We</i> were at a ball on Saturday, I assure you.
We dined at Goodnestone, and in the evening danced
two country-dances and the Boulangeries. I opened
the ball with Edward Bridges<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>; the other couples
were Lewis Cage and Harriet, Frank and Louisa,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Fanny and George. Elizabeth played one country-dance,
Lady Bridges the other, which she made
Henry dance with her, and Miss Finch played the
Boulangeries.</p>

<p>In reading over the last three or four lines, I am
aware of my having expressed myself in so doubtful a
manner that, if I did not tell you to the contrary,
you might imagine it was Lady Bridges who made
Henry dance with her at the same time that she
was playing, which, if not impossible, must appear
a very improbable event to you. But it was Elizabeth
who danced. We supped there and walked
home at night under the shade of two umbrellas.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>We have just got some venison from Godmersham,
which the two Mr. Harveys are to devour to-morrow,
and on Friday or Saturday the Goodnestone people
are to finish their scraps. Henry went away on
Friday, as he purposed, <i>without fayl</i>. You will hear
from him soon, I imagine, as he talked of writing to
Steventon shortly. Mr. Richard Harvey is going
to be married; but as it is a great secret, and only
known to half the neighbourhood, you must not
mention it. The lady's name is Musgrave.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Pray remember me to everybody who does not
enquire after me; those who do, remember me without
bidding. Give my love to Mary Harrison, and
tell her I wish, whenever she is attached to a young
man, some <i>respectable</i> Dr. Marchmont may keep
them apart for five volumes.</p>


<div class='right'>Rowling: Thursday [September 15, 1796].
</div>

<p>At Nackington we met Lady Sondes' picture
over the mantelpiece in the dining-room, and the
pictures of her three children in an ante-room,
besides Mr. Scott, Miss Fletcher, Mr. Toke, Mr. J. Toke,
and the Archdeacon Lynch. Miss Fletcher and I were
very thick, but I am the thinnest of the two. She wore
her purple muslin, which is pretty enough, though
it does not become her complexion. There are two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
traits in her character which are pleasing&mdash;namely,
she admires <i>Camilla</i>, and drinks no cream in her tea.
If you should ever see Lucy, you may tell her that
I scolded Miss Fletcher for her negligence in writing,
as she desired me to do, but without being able to
bring her to any proper sense of shame&mdash;that Miss
Fletcher says in her defence, that as everybody
whom Lucy knew when she was in Canterbury has
now left it, she has nothing at all to write to her
about. By <i>everybody</i>, I suppose Miss Fletcher means
that a new set of officers have arrived there. But
this is a note of my own.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>So His Royal Highness Sir Thomas Williams has
at length sailed; the papers say 'on a cruise.' But
I hope they are gone to Cork, or I shall have written
in vain. Give my love to Jane, as she arrived at
Steventon yesterday, I dare say.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Edward and Frank went out yesterday very
early in a couple of shooting jackets, and came home
like a couple of bad shots, for they killed nothing
at all. They are out again to-day, and are not yet
returned. Delightful sport! They are just come
home, Edward with his two brace, Frank with his
two and a half. What amiable young men!</p>


<div class='right'>Rowling: Sunday [September 18, 1796].
</div>

<p>This morning has been spent in doubt and
deliberation, in forming plans and removing difficulties,
for it ushered in the day with an event which
I had not intended should take place so soon by a week.
Frank has received his appointment on board the
<i>Captain John Gore</i> commanded by the Triton<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> and
will therefore be obliged to be in town on Wednesday;
and though I have every disposition in the
world to accompany him on that day, I cannot go
on the uncertainty of the Pearsons being at home,
as I should not have a place to go to in case they
were from home.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>
<p>My father will be so good as to fetch home his
prodigal daughter from town, I hope, unless he wishes
me to walk the hospitals, enter at the Temple, or
mount guard at St. James'. It will hardly be in
Frank's power to take me home&mdash;nay, it certainly
will not. I shall write again as soon as I get to
Greenwich.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I am very glad that the idea of returning with
Frank occurred to me; for as to Henry's coming into
Kent again, the time of its taking place is so very
uncertain that I should be waiting for <i>dead men's
shoes</i>. I had once determined to go with Frank
to-morrow and take my chance, &amp;c., but they dissuaded
me from so rash a step, as I really think on
consideration it would have been; for if the Pearsons
were not at home, I should inevitably fall a sacrifice
to the arts of some fat woman who would make me
drunk with small beer.</p></div>

<p>In some way or other, Jane managed to reach
Steventon, and at once set to work on <i>First
Impressions</i>. From that point the letters cease
for two years&mdash;namely, till October 1798. Several
family events occurred during the interval. In
January 1797 came the wedding of James Austen
and Mary Lloyd. Owing to the friendship which
had long existed between the Austens and the
Lloyds, this marriage gave great pleasure at
Steventon, and Eliza de Feuillide remarks on it
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>James has chosen a second wife in the person of
Miss Mary Lloyd, who is not either rich or handsome,
but very sensible and good humoured.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Jane
seems much pleased with the match, and it is natural
she should, having long known and liked the lady.</p></div>

<p>Not long after this happy event, the rectory
at Steventon was plunged into deep grief, for news
came that Cassandra's intended husband, Thomas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Fowle, who was expected home from St. Domingo
in a few weeks, had died in February of yellow fever.
Our chief informant is again Eliza de Feuillide, who
writes on May 3:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This is a very severe stroke to the whole family,
and particularly to poor Cassandra, for whom I feel
more than I can express. Indeed I am most sincerely
grieved at this event, and the pain which it must
occasion our worthy relations. Jane says that her
sister behaves with a degree of resolution and propriety
which no common mind could evince in so
trying a situation.</p></div>

<p>His kinsman, Lord Craven, who had taken him out
as chaplain to his regiment, said afterwards that,
had he known of his engagement, he would not have
allowed him to go to so dangerous a climate.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>After such a blow as this, Jane was hardly likely
to leave Cassandra, and the absence of letters at this
time is easily understood. In November of this
same year, Mrs. Austen, whose health was not good
determined to go to Bath with her daughters. The
route from Steventon was by Andover and Devizes,
one night being usually spent at the latter place.
Mrs. Austen's brother, Mr. Leigh Perrot, was a
regular visitor to Bath, and there is every reason to
suppose that Jane had already visited the Leigh
Perrots or the Coopers, or both, at this still fashionable
resort, whose place was only gradually being usurped
by Brighton. Owing to the absence of contemporary
letters our knowledge of her stay there in 1797 is
chiefly derived from reminiscences in later correspondence.
Thus in May 1799, when visiting Bath
again, Jane remarks that it rained almost all the
way from Devizes; 'and our first view of Bath has
been just as gloomy as it was last November twelve-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>month.'
We may therefore imagine them 'entering
Bath on a wet afternoon'&mdash;like Lady Russell, in
<i>Persuasion</i>&mdash;'and driving through the long course
of streets .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. amidst the dash of other carriages,
the heavy rumble of carts and drays, the bawling of
newsmen, muffin-men and milkmen, and the ceaseless
clink of pattens.' The Austens probably stayed with
the Perrots at their house, No. 1 Paragon Buildings.</p>

<p>Writing in April 1805, Jane describes a visit to a
riding-school, and says: 'Seven years and four months
ago we went to the same riding-house to see Miss
Lefroy's performance. What a different set are we
now moving in!' It would be interesting to know
in what way the set differed, whether in kind or only
in the individuals composing it. In this earlier visit
Jane was likely to have seen plenty of company, as
the Leigh Perrots had a large acquaintance.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> The
Austens stayed at Bath into December, for Elizabeth
de Feuillide mentions, on December 11, that she had
heard very lately from Jane, 'who is still at Bath
with her mother and sister. Mr. Hampson, whom I
saw yesterday .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. told me he had heard Cassandra
was going to be married, but Jane says not a word of
it.' When we think of Jane's silence, and still more
of Cassandra's recent grief, we may safely discredit
this extremely improbable rumour.</p>

<p>On returning home for Christmas, they received
a piece of news which, even if it did not come entirely
as a surprise, can hardly have given unmixed pleasure.
This was the engagement of Henry Austen to his
cousin, Eliza de Feuillide&mdash;his senior by some ten
years. Intended originally for the Church, Henry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Austen had abandoned the idea of taking Orders,
and had joined the Oxford Militia as lieutenant,
in 1793, becoming adjutant and captain four years
later. Though he was endowed with many attractive
gifts there was a certain infirmity of purpose
in his character that was hardly likely to be
remedied by a marriage to his very pleasure-loving
cousin.</p>

<p>In default of Eliza's letter on the occasion to her
uncle, we may quote that which she wrote to Warren
Hastings:&mdash;</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;As I flatter myself you still take an
interest in my welfare, I think it incumbent on me
to acquaint you with a circumstance by which it
must be materially influenced. I have consented
to an Union with my Cousin, Captain Austen, who
has the honour of being known to you. He has
been for some time in Possession of a comfortable
income, and the excellence of his Heart, Temper and
Understanding, together with steady attachment to
me, his Affection for my little Boy, and disinterested
concurrence in the disposal of my Property in favour
of this latter, have at length induced me to an
acquiescence which I have withheld for more than
two years. Need I say, my dear Sir, that I most
earnestly wish for your approbation on this occasion,
and that it is with the sincerest attachment I shall
ever remain</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 6em;">Your much obliged</span><br />
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">and affectionate God-daughter,</span><br />

<span class="smcap">Elizabeth de Feuillide.</span>
</div>

<p>I beg leave to present my affectionate compliments
to Mrs. Hastings.</p>

<p>
December 26, 1797.
</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Neither side wished for a long engagement, and
they were married on December 31. Henry continued
with the Militia regiment probably till the
Peace of 1802. By 1804 he had joined a brother
Militia officer of the name of Maunde, and set up as
banker and army agent, with offices in Albany, Piccadilly;
removing in or before 1808 to 10 Henrietta
Street, Covent Garden. Poor little Hastings de
Feuillide became subject to epilepsy, and died on
October 9, 1801, while the Henry Austens were
living in Upper Berkeley Street.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>During the first half of 1798, Jane, fresh from her
late visit to Bath, was able to devote some happy
months of unbroken leisure to writing the first draft
of the book known to us as <i>Northanger Abbey;</i>
but her comedy was once more interrupted by one of
the tragedies of real life. On August 9 occurred the
death of her cousin, Lady Williams (Jane Cooper):
while she was driving herself in a whiskey, a dray-horse
ran away and drove against the chaise. She was
thrown out and killed on the spot: 'never spoke
again,' so Mrs. Lybbe Powys records the news on
August 14. Jane Williams had been married from
Steventon Rectory, and had been, both before and
after that event, so frequent a visitor there that her
death must have been severely felt by the Austens&mdash;especially
by the daughters of the family, her
friends and contemporaries.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>GODMERSHAM AND STEVENTON</h3>

<h3>1798-1799</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>Some</span> change after this shock must have been desirable;
and at the end of the same month Mr. and Mrs.
Austen, with Cassandra and Jane, started on a visit
to the Edward Austens&mdash;no longer at Rowling but
at Godmersham, which, by the generosity of Mrs.
Knight, was now become their residence. Edward
would naturally wish for a visit from his parents and
sisters in his new and beautiful home. We know
very little of Jane's doings there, except that she
attended a ball at Ashford; but, on her parting
from Cassandra (who was left behind) and returning
to Steventon with her father and mother, we find
ourselves fortunately in the company of the letters
once more. Mrs. Austen was at this time in poor
health, and Jane evidently felt the responsibility of
taking charge of her in Cassandra's absence.</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'>'Bull and George,' Dartford: Wednesday [October 24, 1798].
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cassandra</span>,&mdash;You have already heard
from Daniel, I conclude, in what excellent time we
reached and quitted Sittingbourne, and how very
well my mother bore her journey thither. I am now
able to send you a continuation of the same good
account of her. She was very little fatigued on her
arrival at this place, has been refreshed by a comfortable
dinner, and now seems quite stout. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
wanted five minutes of twelve when we left Sittingbourne,
from whence we had a famous pair of horses,
which took us to Rochester in an hour and a quarter;
the postboy seemed determined to show my mother
that Kentish drivers were not always tedious, and
really drove as fast as <i>Cax</i>.</p>

<p>Our next stage was not quite so expeditiously
performed; the load was heavy and our horses very
indifferent. However, we were in such good time,
and my mother bore her journey so well, that expedition
was of little importance to us; and as it
was, we were very little more than two hours and
a half coming hither, and it was scarcely past four
when we stopped at the inn.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I should have begun my letter soon after our
arrival but for a little adventure which prevented me.
After we had been here a quarter of an hour it was
discovered that my writing and dressing boxes had
been by accident put into a chaise which was just
packing off as we came in, and were driven away
towards Gravesend in their way to the West Indies.
No part of my property could have been such a prize
before, for in my writing box was all my worldly
wealth, &pound;7, and my dear Harry's deputation.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Mr.
Nottley immediately despatched a man and horse
after the chaise, and in half an hour's time I had
the pleasure of being as rich as ever; they were got
about two or three miles off.</p>

<p>My day's journey has been pleasanter in every
respect than I expected. I have been very little
crowded and by no means unhappy. Your watchfulness
with regard to the weather on our accounts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
was very kind and very effectual. We had one heavy
shower on leaving Sittingbourne, but afterwards
the clouds cleared away, and we had a very bright
<i>chrystal</i> afternoon.</p>

<p>My father is now reading the <i>Midnight Bell</i><a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
which he has got from the library, and mother sitting
by the fire. Our route to-morrow is not determined.
We have none of us much inclination for London,
and if Mr. Nottley will give us leave, I think we
shall go to Staines through Croydon and Kingston,
which will be much pleasanter than any other way;
but he is decidedly for Clapham and Battersea. God
bless you all!</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">Yours affectionately,</span><br />

J. A.
</div>

<p>I flatter myself that <i>itty Dordy</i><a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> will not forget
me at least under a week. Kiss him for me.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Steventon: Saturday [October 27, 1798].
</div>

<p>We arrived here yesterday between four and five,
but I cannot send you quite so triumphant an account
of our last day's journey as of the first and second.
Soon after I had finished my letter from Staines, my
mother began to suffer from the exercise or fatigue
of travelling, and she was a good deal indisposed.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>James called on us just as we were going to tea,
and my mother was well enough to talk very cheerfully
to him before she went to bed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They
[James and Mary] were to have dined here to-day,
but the weather is too bad. I have had the pleasure
of hearing that Martha is with them. James fetched
her from Ibthorp on Thursday, and she will stay
with them till she removes to Kintbury.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>I am very grand indeed; I had the dignity of
dropping out my mother's laudanum last night.
I carry about the keys of the wine and closet,
and twice since I began this letter have had orders
to give in the kitchen. Our dinner was very good
yesterday and the chicken boiled perfectly tender;
therefore I shall not be obliged to dismiss Nanny on
that account.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Your letter was chaperoned here by one from
Mrs. Cooke, in which she says that <i>Battleridge</i><a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> is
not to come out before January, and she is so little
satisfied with Cawthorn's dilatoriness that she never
means to employ him again.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hall, of Sherborne, was brought to bed
yesterday of a dead child, some weeks before she
expected, owing to a fright. I suppose she happened
unawares to look at her husband.</p>

<p>There has been a great deal of rain here for this
last fortnight, much more than in Kent, and indeed
we found the roads all the way from Staines most
disgracefully dirty. Steventon Lane has its full
share of it, and I don't know when I shall be able
to get to Deane.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>My dear <i>itty Dordy's</i> remembrance of me is very
pleasing to me&mdash;foolishly pleasing, because I know it
will be over so soon. My attachment to him will be
more durable. I shall think with tenderness and
delight on his beautiful and smiling countenance and
interesting manner until a few years have turned
him into an ungovernable ungracious fellow.</p>

<p>The books from Winton are all unpacked and put
away; the binding has compressed them most
conveniently, and there is now very good room in the
bookcase for all that we wish to have there. I believe
the servants were all very glad to see us. Nanny was,
I am sure. She confesses that it was very dull, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
yet she had her child with her till last Sunday.
I understand that there are some grapes left, but
I believe not many; they must be gathered as soon
as possible, or this rain will entirely rot them.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Saturday [November 17, 1798].<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
</div>

<p>My mother desires me to tell you that I am a very
good housekeeper, which I have no reluctance in
doing, because I really think it my peculiar excellence,
and for this reason&mdash;I always take care to provide
such things as please my own appetite, which I
consider as the chief merit in housekeeping. I have
had some ragout veal, and I mean to have some
haricot mutton to-morrow. We are to kill a pig soon.</p>

<p>There is to be a ball at Basingstoke next Thursday.
Our assemblies have very kindly declined
ever since we laid down the carriage, so that dis-convenience
and dis-inclination to go have kept
pace together.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;I have just received a note from James
to say that Mary was brought to bed last night, at
eleven o'clock, of a fine little boy,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> and that everything
is going on very well. My mother had desired
to know nothing of it before it should be all over,
and we were clever enough to prevent her having
any suspicion of it, though Jenny, who had been
left here by her mistress, was sent for home.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Steventon: Sunday [November 25, 1798].
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sister</span>,&mdash;I expected to have heard
from you this morning, but no letter is come. I
shall not take the trouble of announcing to you
any more of Mary's children, if, instead of thanking
me for the intelligence, you always sit down and
write to James. I am sure nobody can desire your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
letters so much as I do, and I don't think anybody
deserves them so well.</p>

<p>Having now relieved my heart of a great deal
of malevolence, I will proceed to tell you that Mary
continues quite well, and my mother tolerably so.
I saw the former on Friday, and though I had seen
her comparatively hearty the Tuesday before, I
was really amazed at the improvement which three
days had made in her. She looked well, her spirits
were perfectly good, and she spoke much more
vigorously than Elizabeth did when we left Godmersham.
I had only a glimpse at the child, who
was asleep; but Miss Debary told me that his eyes
were large, dark, and handsome. <i>She</i> looks much as
she used to do, is netting herself a gown in worsteds,
and wears what Mrs. Birch would call a <i>pot hat</i>.
A short and compendious history of Miss Debary!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>We have got <i>Fitz-Albini;</i><a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> my father has bought
it against my private wishes, for it does not quite
satisfy my feelings that we should purchase the
only one of Egerton's works of which his family
are ashamed. That these scruples, however, do not
at all interfere with my reading it, you will easily
believe. We have neither of us yet finished the
first volume. My father is disappointed&mdash;<i>I</i> am not,
for I expected nothing better. Never did any book
carry more internal evidence of its author. Every
sentiment is completely Egerton's. There is very
little story, and what there is is told in a strange,
unconnected way. There are many characters
introduced, apparently merely to be delineated.
We have not been able to recognise any of them
hitherto, except Dr. and Mrs. Hey and Mr. Oxenden,
who is not very tenderly treated.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>We have got Boswell's <i>Tour to the Hebrides</i>,
and are to have his <i>Life of Johnson;</i> and as some
money will yet remain in Burdon's hands, it is to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
laid out in the purchase of Cowper's works. This
would please Mr. Clarke, could he know it.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Steventon: [December 1, 1798.]
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cassandra</span>,&mdash;I am so good as to write
you again thus speedily, to let you know that I have
just heard from Frank. He was at Cadiz, alive and
well, on October 19, and had then very lately received
a letter from you, written as long ago as when the
<i>London</i> was at St. Helen's. But his <i>raly</i> latest
intelligence of us was in one from me of September 1st,
which I sent soon after we got to Godmersham. He
had written a packet full for his dearest friends in
England, early in October, to go by the <i>Excellent;</i>
but the <i>Excellent</i> was not sailed, nor likely to sail,
when he despatched this to me. It comprehended
letters for both of us, for Lord Spencer,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Mr. Daysh,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
and the East India Directors. Lord St. Vincent had
left the fleet when he wrote, and was gone to Gibraltar,
it was said to superintend the fitting out of a private
expedition from thence against some of the enemies'
ports; Minorca or Malta were conjectured to be the
objects.</p>

<p>Frank writes in good spirits, but says that our
correspondence cannot be so easily carried on in
future as it has been, as the communication between
Cadiz and Lisbon is less frequent than formerly. You
and my mother, therefore, must not alarm yourselves
at the long intervals that may divide his letters.
I address this advice to you two as being the most
tender-hearted of the family.</p>

<p>My mother made her <i>entr&eacute;e</i> into the dressing-room
through crowds of admiring spectators yesterday
afternoon, and we all drank tea together for the first
time these five weeks. She has had a tolerable night,
and bids fair for a continuance in the same brilliant
course of action to-day.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Mr. Lyford<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> was here yesterday; he came while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
we were at dinner, and partook of our elegant entertainment.
I was not ashamed at asking him to sit
down to table, for we had some pease-soup, a sparerib,
and a pudding. He wants my mother to look yellow
and to throw out a rash, but she will do neither.</p>

<p>We live entirely in the dressing-room now, which
I like very much; I always feel so much more elegant
in it than in the parlour.</p>

<p>I have made myself two or three caps to wear of
evenings since I came home, and they save me a world
of torment as to hair-dressing, which at present gives
me no trouble beyond washing and brushing, for my
long hair is always plaited up out of sight, and my
short hair curls well enough to want no papering.</p>

<p><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;My father is glad to hear so good an
account of Edward's pigs, and desires he may be told,
as encouragement to his taste for them, that Lord
Bolton is particularly curious in <i>his</i> pigs, has had
pigstyes of a most elegant construction built for them,
and visits them every morning as soon as he rises.</p></div>

<p>This and the following letter contain allusions
to Jane's wearing caps. Those intended for use at
balls, &amp;c. would be smart head-dresses, worn at
that period by younger as well as older women.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
In later life, the Miss Austens seem to have been
rather indifferent to fashion and beauty in their
clothing, although always very neat.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'><br />Steventon: Tuesday [December 18, 1798].
</div>

<p>I took the liberty a few days ago of asking your
black velvet bonnet to lend me its cawl, which it
very readily did, and by which I have been enabled
to give a considerable improvement of dignity to my
cap, which was before too <i>nidgetty</i> to please me. I
shall wear it on Thursday, but I hope you will not be
offended with me for following your advice as to its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
ornaments only in part. I still venture to retain the
narrow silver round it, put twice round without any
bow, and instead of the black military feather shall
put in the coquelicot one as being smarter, and
besides, coquelicot is to be all the fashion this winter.
After the ball I shall probably make it entirely black.</p>

<p>I am sorry that our dear Charles begins to feel the
dignity of ill-usage. My father will write to Admiral
Gambier.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> He must have already received so much
satisfaction from his acquaintance and patronage of
Frank, that he will be delighted, I dare say, to have
another of the family introduced to him.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I am very much obliged to my dear little George
for his message&mdash;for his <i>love</i> at least; his <i>duty</i>, I
suppose, was only in consequence of some hint of my
favourable intentions towards him from his father or
mother. I am sincerely rejoiced, however, that I
ever was born, since it has been the means of procuring
him a dish of tea.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Give my best love to him.</p>

<p>I have received a very civil note from Mrs. Martin,
requesting my name as a subscriber to her library,
which opens January 14, and my name, or rather
yours, is accordingly given. My mother finds the
money. Mary subscribes too, which I am glad of,
but hardly expected. As an inducement to subscribe,
Mrs. Martin tells me that her collection is not
to consist only of novels, but of every kind of literature,
&amp;c. She might have spared this pretension to
<i>our</i> family, who are great novel-readers and not
ashamed of being so; but it was necessary, I suppose,
to the self-consequence of half her subscribers.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I enjoyed the hard black frosts of last week very
much, and one day while they lasted walked to
Deane by myself. I do not know that I ever did
such a thing in my life before.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>We dine now at half-past three, and have done
dinner, I suppose, before you begin. We drink tea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
at half-past six. I am afraid you will despise us.
My father reads Cowper to us in the morning, to
which I listen when I can. How do you spend your
evenings? I guess that Elizabeth works, that you
read to her, and that Edward goes to sleep.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;I have changed my mind, and
changed the trimmings of my cap this morning;
they are now such as you suggested. I felt as if I
should not prosper if I strayed from your directions,
and I think it makes me look more like Lady
Conyngham now than it did before, which is all that
one lives for now. I believe I <i>shall</i> make my new
gown like my robe, but the back of the latter is
all in a piece with the tail, and will seven yards
enable me to copy it in that respect?</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>People get so horribly poor and economical in this
part of the world that I have no patience with them.
Kent is the only place for happiness; everybody is
rich there. I must do similar justice, however, to
the Windsor neighbourhood.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Steventon: Monday night [December 24, 1798].
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cassandra</span>,&mdash;I have got some pleasant
news for you which I am eager to communicate, and
therefore begin my letter sooner, though I shall not
<i>send</i> it sooner than usual.</p>

<p>Admiral Gambier, in reply to my father's application,
writes as follows:&mdash;'As it is usual to keep
young officers in small vessels, it being most proper
on account of their inexperience, and it being also a
situation where they are more in the way of learning
their duty, your son has been continued in the
<i>Scorpion;</i> but I have mentioned to the Board of
Admiralty his wish to be in a frigate, and when a
proper opportunity offers and it is judged that he
has taken his turn in a small ship, I hope he will be
removed. With regard to your son now in the
<i>London</i> I am glad I can give you the assurance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
that his promotion is likely to take place very soon,
as Lord Spencer has been so good as to say he would
include him in an arrangement that he proposes
making in a short time relative to some promotions
in that quarter.'</p>

<p>There! I may now finish my letter and go and
hang myself, for I am sure I can neither write nor do
anything which will not appear insipid to you after
this. <i>Now</i>, I really think he will soon be made, and
only wish we could communicate our foreknowledge
of the event to him whom it principally concerns. My
father has written to Daysh to desire that he will inform
us, if he can, when the commission is sent. Your chief
wish is now ready to be accomplished; and could Lord
Spencer give happiness to Martha at the same time,
what a joyful heart he would make of yours!</p>

<p>I have sent the same extract of the sweets of
Gambier to Charles, who, poor fellow, though he sinks
into nothing but an humble attendant on the hero of
the piece, will, I hope, be contented with the prospect
held out to him. By what the Admiral says,
it appears as if he had been designedly kept in the
<i>Scorpion</i>. But I will not torment myself with conjectures
and suppositions; facts shall satisfy me.</p>

<p>Frank had not heard from any of us for ten weeks
when he wrote me on November 12 in consequence
of Lord St. Vincent being removed to Gibraltar.
When his commission is sent, however, it will not be
so long on its road as our letters, because all the
Government despatches are forwarded by land to his
lordship from Lisbon with great regularity.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I spent my time [at Manydown] very quietly and
very pleasantly with Catherine. Miss Blachford is
agreeable enough. I do not want people to be very
agreeable, as it saves me the trouble of liking them a
great deal.</p>

<p>Our ball was very thin, but by no means unpleasant.
There were thirty-one people, and only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
eleven ladies out of the number, and but five single
women in the room. Of the gentlemen present you
may have some idea from the list of my partners&mdash;Mr.
Wood, G. Lefroy, Rice, a Mr. Butcher (belonging
to the Temples, a sailor and not of the 11th Light
Dragoons), Mr. Temple (not the horrid one of all), Mr.
Wm. Orde (cousin to the Kingsclere man), Mr. John
Harwood, and Mr. Calland, who appeared as usual
with his hat in his hand, and stood every now and then
behind Catherine and me to be talked to and abused
for not dancing. We teased him, however, into it at
last. I was very glad to see him again after so long a
separation, and he was altogether rather the genius
and flirt of the evening. He enquired after you.</p>

<p>There were twenty dances, and I danced them
all, and without any fatigue. I was glad to find
myself capable of dancing so much, and with so much
satisfaction as I did; from my slender enjoyment of
the Ashford balls (as assemblies for dancing) I had
not thought myself equal to it, but in cold weather
and with few couples I fancy I could just as well
dance for a week together as for half an hour. My
black cap was openly admired by Mrs. Lefroy, and
secretly I imagine by everybody else in the room.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;I thank you for your long letter, which
I will endeavour to deserve by writing the rest of
this as closely as possible. I am full of joy at much
of your information; that you should have been to a
ball, and have danced at it, and supped with the
Prince, and that you should meditate the purchase
of a new muslin gown, are delightful circumstances.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Poor Edward! It is very hard that he, who has
everything else in the world that he can wish for,
should not have good health too.</p>

<p>I know no one more deserving of happiness without
alloy than Edward is.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Of my charities to the poor since I came home you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
shall have a faithful account. I have given a pair of
worsted stockings to Mary Hutchins, Dame Kew,
Mary Steevens, and Dame Staples; a shift to Hannah
Staples, and a shawl to Betty Dawkins; amounting
in all to about half a guinea. But I have no reason
to suppose that the <i>Battys</i> would accept of anything,
because I have not made them the offer.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The Lords of the Admiralty will have enough of
our applications at present, for I hear from Charles
that he has written to Lord Spencer himself to be
removed. I am afraid his Serene Highness will be in
a passion, and order some of our heads to be cut off.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Steventon: Friday [December 28, 1798].
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cassandra</span>,&mdash;Frank is made. He was
yesterday raised to the rank of Commander, and appointed
to the <i>Peterel</i> sloop, now at Gibraltar. A letter
from Daysh has just announced this, and as it is confirmed
by a very friendly one from Mr. Mathew to the
same effect, transcribing one from Admiral Gambier to
the General,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> we have no reason to suspect the truth of it.</p>

<p>As soon as you have cried a little for joy, you
may go on, and learn farther that the India House
have taken <i>Captain Austen's</i> petition into consideration&mdash;this
comes from Daysh&mdash;and likewise that
Lieutenant Charles John Austen is removed to
the <i>Tamar</i> frigate&mdash;this comes from the Admiral.
We cannot find out where the <i>Tamar</i> is, but I hope
we shall now see Charles here at all events.</p>

<p>This letter is to be dedicated entirely to good
news. If you will send my father an account of your
washing and letter expenses, &amp;c., he will send you a
draft for the amount of it, as well as for your next
quarter,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> and for Edward's rent. If you don't buy
a muslin gown now on the strength of this money and
Frank's promotion, I shall never forgive you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>
<p>Mrs. Lefroy has just sent me word that Lady
Dorchester meant to invite me to her ball on
January 8, which, though an humble blessing compared
with what the last page records, I do not
consider as any calamity.</p>

<p>I cannot write any more now, but I have written
enough to make you very happy, and therefore may
safely conclude.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Steventon: Tuesday [January 8, 1799].
</div>

<p>I am tolerably glad to hear that Edward's income
is a good one&mdash;as glad as I can be at anybody's
being rich except you and me&mdash;and I am thoroughly
rejoiced to hear of his present to you.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I assure you that I dread the idea of going to
Brighton<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> as much as you do, but I am not without
hopes that something may happen to prevent it.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>[<i>Wednesday.</i>]&mdash;You express so little anxiety about
my being murdered under Ashe Park Copse by Mrs.
Hulbert's servant, that I have a great mind not to tell
you whether I was or not, and shall only say that I
did not return home that night or the next, as Martha
kindly made room for me in her bed, which was the
shut-up one in the new nursery. Nurse and the
child slept upon the floor, and there we all were in
some confusion and great comfort. The bed did
exceedingly well for us, both to lie awake in and talk
till two o'clock, and to sleep in the rest of the night.
I love Martha better than ever, and I mean to go
and see her, if I can, when she gets home. We all
dined at the Harwoods' on Thursday, and the party
broke up the next morning.</p>

<p>My sweet little George! I am delighted to hear
that he has such an inventive genius as to face-making.
I admired his yellow wafer very much, and hope he
will choose the wafer for your next letter. I wore my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
green shoes last night, and took my <i>white fan</i> with
me; I am very glad he never threw it into the river.</p>

<p>Mrs. Knight<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> giving up the Godmersham estate
to Edward was no such prodigious act of generosity
after all, it seems, for she has reserved herself an
income out of it still; this ought to be known, that
her conduct may not be overrated. I rather think
Edward shows the most magnanimity of the two, in
accepting her resignation with such incumbrances.</p>

<p>The more I write, the better my eye gets, so I shall
at least keep on till it is quite well, before I give up
my pen to my mother.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I do not think I was very much in request [at the
Kempshot ball]. People were rather apt not to ask
me till they could not help it; one's consequence, you
know, varies so much at times without any particular
reason. There was one gentleman, an officer of the
Cheshire, a very good-looking young man, who, I was
told, wanted very much to be introduced to me;
but as he did not want it quite enough to take much
trouble in effecting it, we never could bring it about.</p>

<p>I danced with Mr. John Wood again, twice with a
Mr. South, a lad from Winchester, who, I suppose,
is as far from being related to the bishop of that
diocese as it is possible to be, with G. Lefroy, and
J. Harwood, who I think takes to me rather more
than he used to do. One of my gayest actions was
sitting down two dances in preference to having
Lord Bolton's eldest son for my partner, who danced
too ill to be endured. The Miss Charterises were
there, and played the parts of the Miss Edens with
great spirit. Charles never came. Naughty Charles!
I suppose he could not get superseded in time.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I do not wonder at your wanting to read <i>First
Impressions</i> again, so seldom as you have gone
through it, and that so long ago.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>
<p>I <i>shall</i> be able to send this to the post to-day,
which exalts me to the utmost pinnacle of human
felicity, and makes me bask in the sunshine of prosperity,
or gives me any other sensation of pleasure
in studied language which you may prefer. Do not
be angry with me for not filling my sheet, and believe
me yours affectionately,</p>

<div class='signature'>
J. A.
</div>


<div class='right'><br />Steventon: Monday [January 21, 1799].
</div>

<p>Charles leaves us to-night. The <i>Tamar</i> is in
the Downs, and Mr. Daysh advises him to join her
there directly, as there is no chance of her going
to the westward. Charles does not approve of this
at all, and will not be much grieved if he should
be too late for her before she sails, as he may then
hope to get into a better station. He attempted
to go to town last night, and got as far on his road
thither as Deane Gate, but both the coaches were
full, and we had the pleasure of seeing him back
again.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Martha writes me word that Charles was very
much admired at Kintbury, and Mrs. Lefroy never
saw anyone so much improved in her life, and thinks
him handsomer than Henry. He appears to far more
advantage here than he did at Godmersham, not
surrounded by strangers and neither oppressed by a
pain in his face or powder in his hair.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Yesterday came a letter to my mother from
Edward Cooper to announce, not the birth of a child,
but of a living; for Mrs. Leigh<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> has begged his
acceptance of the Rectory of Hamstall-Ridware in
Staffordshire, vacant by Mr. Johnson's death. We
collect from his letter that he means to reside
there, in which he shows his wisdom. Staffordshire
is a good way off; so we shall see nothing more of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
them till, some fifteen years hence, the Miss Coopers
are presented to us, fine, jolly, handsome, ignorant
girls. The living is valued at &pound;140 a year, but
perhaps it may be improvable. How will they be
able to convey the furniture of the dressing-room
so far in safety?</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Our first cousins seem all dropping off very fast.
One is incorporated into the family,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> another dies,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
and a third goes into Staffordshire.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>[<i>Tuesday.</i>]&mdash;Our own particular brother got a place
in the coach last night, and is now, I suppose, in town.
I have no objection at all to your buying our gowns
there, as your imagination has pictured to you
exactly such a one as is necessary to make me happy.
You quite abash me by your progress in notting,
for I am still without silk. You must get me some
in town or in Canterbury; it should be finer than
yours.</p>

<p>I thought Edward would not approve of Charles
being a crop,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> and rather wished you to conceal it
from him at present, lest it might fall on his spirits
and retard his recovery.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;I have just heard from Charles,
who is by this time at Deal. He is to be Second
Lieutenant, which pleases him very well. The
<i>Endymion</i> is come into the Downs, which pleases
him likewise. He expects to be ordered to Sheerness
shortly, as the <i>Tamar</i> has never been refitted.</p>

<p>My father and mother made the same match
for you last night, and are very much pleased with
it. <i>He</i> is a beauty of my mother's.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>THE LEIGH PERROTS AND BATH</h3>

<h3>1799-1800</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>Mrs. Austen's</span> brother, James Leigh Perrot, and
his wife had for many years led a prosperous and
uneventful life at Scarlets, enjoying the respect and
friendship of a large circle of acquaintances. Scarlets
was a small property on the Bath road, about thirty
miles from London, adjoining the hamlet of Hare
Hatch, where (as was often the case on a great highroad)
a number of gentlemen's places of moderate size
were congregated within easy reach of each other.
Among those who sooner or later were neighbours
of the Leigh Perrots were Maria Edgeworth's father
Richard Lovell Edgeworth (who speaks of the help
he received from Mr. Perrot in his experiments
of telegraphing from Hare Hatch to Nettlebed by
means of windmills), and Thomas Day, the author
of <i>Sandford and Merton</i>. The house at Scarlets in
its then existing shape was the work of Mr. Leigh
Perrot, and was of a suitable size for a childless
couple in easy circumstances. Its owner had
abilities which might have stood him in good stead
in any profession, had he adopted one; and he was
of a kind and affectionate disposition, combining an
easy temper with ready wit, and much resolution<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
of character. His wife was hardly formed for
popularity, but she was highly respected. She was
not exactly open-handed, but she had a great idea
of the claims of family ties, and a keen sense of
justice as between herself and others. The couple
were unusually devoted to each other. The only
crook in their lot appeared to be the constant gout
attacks from which the husband suffered, and the
necessity for frequent visits to Bath: visits, by the
way, which had helped to give to their niece, Jane
Austen, such good opportunities for studying the
Bath varieties of human nature.</div>

<p>The journey, however, of the Austens to Bath in
the spring of 1799 (described in our next letters) was
independent of the Leigh Perrots. Edward Austen
had been suffering, like his uncle, from gout, and
determined to try the waters of Bath; his mother
and Jane accompanying his family party thither.
But the Perrots were already settled in Paragon
Buildings<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> when the Austens arrived, and the two
families would be constantly meeting.</p>

<p>The Austens took up their quarters in Queen
Square, which Jane seems to have liked much
better than she made her Miss Musgroves like it
when she wrote <i>Persuasion</i>, sixteen years later.</p>


<div class="blockquot"><div class='right'>13 Queen Square: Friday [May 17, 1799].
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dearest Cassandra</span>,&mdash;Our journey yesterday
went off exceedingly well; nothing occurred to alarm
or delay us. We found the roads in excellent order,
had very good horses all the way, and reached Devizes
with ease by four o'clock. I suppose John has told
you in what manner we were divided when we left<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Andover, and no alteration was afterwards made.
At Devizes we had comfortable rooms and a good
dinner, to which we sat down about five; amongst
other things we had asparagus and a lobster, which
made me wish for you, and some cheesecakes, on
which the children<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> made so delightful a supper as to
endear the town of Devizes to them for a long time.</p>

<p>Well, here we are at Bath; we got here about
one o'clock, and have been arrived just long enough
to go over the house, fix on our rooms, and be very
well pleased with the whole of it. Poor Elizabeth has
had a dismal ride of it from Devizes, for it has rained
almost all the way, and our first view of Bath has been
just as gloomy as it was last November twelvemonth.</p>

<p>I have got so many things to say, so many things
equally important, that I know not on which to
decide at present, and shall therefore go and eat
with the children.</p>

<p>We stopped in Paragon as we came along, but as
it was too wet and dirty for us to get out, we could
only see Frank, who told us that his master was
very indifferent, but had had a better night last
night than usual.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>We are exceedingly pleased with the house; the
rooms are quite as large as we expected. Mrs.
Bromley is a fat woman in mourning, and a little
black kitten runs about the staircase. Elizabeth has
the apartment within the drawing-room; she wanted
my mother to have it, but as there was no bed in the
inner one, and the stairs are so much easier of ascent,
or my mother so much stronger than in Paragon as
not to regard the double flight, it is settled for us to
be above, where we have two very nice-sized rooms,
with dirty quilts and everything comfortable. I have
the outward and larger apartment, as I ought to have;
which is quite as large as our bed-room at home,
and my mother's is not materially less. The beds are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
both as large as any at Steventon, and I have a very
nice chest of drawers and a closet full of shelves&mdash;so
full indeed that there is nothing else in it, and it
should therefore be called a cupboard rather than a
closet, I suppose.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>There was a very long list of arrivals here in the
newspaper yesterday, so that we need not immediately
dread absolute solitude; and there is a public breakfast
in Sydney Gardens every morning, so that we
shall not be wholly starved.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">Yours very affectionately,</span><br />

<span class="smcap">Jane.</span>
</div>


<div class='right'><br />13 Queen Square: Sunday [June 2, 1799].
</div>

<p>Flowers are very much worn, and fruit is still
more the thing. Elizabeth has a bunch of strawberries,
and I have seen grapes, cherries, plums, and
apricots. There are likewise almonds and raisins,
French plums, and tamarinds at the grocers', but I
have never seen any of them in hats. A plum or
greengage would cost three shillings; cherries and
grapes about five, I believe, but this is at some of
the dearest shops. My aunt has told me of a very
cheap one, near Walcot Church, to which I shall go in
quest of something for you. I have never seen an
old woman at the pump-room.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I spent Friday evening with the Mapletons, and
was obliged to submit to being pleased in spite of
my inclination. We took a very charming walk
from six to eight up Beacon Hill, and across some
fields, to the village of Charlecombe, which is sweetly
situated in a little green valley, as a village with
such a name ought to be. Marianne is sensible and
intelligent, and even Jane, considering how fair she
is, is not unpleasant. We had a Miss North and a
Mr. Gould of our party; the latter walked home
with me after tea. He is a very young man, just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
entered Oxford, wears spectacles, and has heard that
<i>Evelina</i> was written by Dr. Johnson.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>There is to be a grand gala on Tuesday evening<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
in Sydney Gardens, a concert, with illuminations and
fireworks. To the latter Elizabeth and I look forward
with pleasure, and even the concert will have more
than its usual charm for me, as the gardens are large
enough for me to get pretty well beyond the reach
of its sound. In the morning Lady Willoughby is to
present the colours to some corps, or Yeomanry, or
other, in the Crescent.</p>


<div class='right'><br />13 Queen Square: Tuesday [June 11, 1799].
</div>

<p>I would not let Martha read <i>First Impressions</i>
again upon any account, and am very glad that I did
not leave it in your power. She is very cunning, but
I saw through her design; she means to publish it
from memory, and one more perusal must enable
her to do it. As for <i>Fitz-Albini</i>, when I get home
she shall have it, as soon as ever she will own that
Mr. Elliott is handsomer than Mr. Lance, that fair
men are preferable to black; for I mean to take
every opportunity of rooting out her prejudices.</p>

<p>I am very glad you liked my lace, and so are you,
and so is Martha, and we are all glad together. I
have got your cloak home, which is quite delightful&mdash;as
delightful at least as half the circumstances which
are called so.</p>

<p>I do not know what is the matter with me to-day,
but I cannot write quietly; I am always wandering
away into some exclamation or other. Fortunately
I have nothing very particular to say.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Fanny desires her love to you, her love to grandpapa,
her love to Anna, and her love to Hannah;
the latter is particularly to be remembered. Edward
desires his love to you, to grandpapa, to Anna, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
little Edward, to Aunt James and Uncle James,
and he hopes all your turkeys and ducks, and chicken
and guinea fowls are very well; and he wishes you
very much to send him a printed letter, and so
does Fanny&mdash;and they both rather think they shall
answer it.</p>


<div class='right'><br />13 Queen Square: Wednesday [June 19, 1799].
</div>

<p>Last Sunday we all drank tea in Paragon; my
uncle is still in his flannels, but is getting better again.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Last night we were in Sydney Gardens again, as
there was a repetition of the gala which went off
so ill on the 4th. We did not go till nine, and then
were in very good time for the fireworks, which were
really beautiful, and surpassing my expectation;
the illuminations too were very pretty. The weather
was as favourable as it was otherwise a fortnight
ago. The play on Saturday is, <i>I hope</i>, to conclude
our gaieties here, for nothing but a lengthened stay
will make it otherwise. We go with Mrs. Fellowes.</p></div>

<p>The Austens quitted Bath on Wednesday, June 26,
reaching Steventon on the following day, and leaving
the Leigh Perrots to an unexpected fate&mdash;which they
had done nothing whatever to deserve.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>On Thursday, August 8, Mrs. Leigh Perrot went
into a milliner's shop at the corner of Bath and Stall
Streets, kept by a certain Mrs. Gregory (but known
as Smith's), and bought a piece of <i>black</i> lace. She
paid for it, and took it away wrapped up in a piece of
paper. After leaving the shop, Mrs. Perrot met her
husband and strolled about with him. As they
re-passed the same shop a quarter of an hour later,
Mrs. Gregory rushed out and accused Mrs. Perrot of
having in her possession a piece of <i>white</i> lace. Mrs.
Perrot replied that if so it must have been put up in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
her parcel by mistake. She then handed her parcel to
Mrs. Gregory to examine, when a piece of <i>white</i> lace
was found therein as well as a piece of <i>black</i>. Mrs.
Gregory at once accused Mrs. Perrot of having stolen
it, and, refusing to listen to any protest, made off with
the incriminating piece of lace. A little later, as the
Perrots were turning the corner of the Abbey Churchyard,
Charles Filby, the shop assistant who had
actually sold the black lace, came up and asked
Mr. Perrot his name. Mr. Perrot replied that he
lived at No. 1 Paragon Buildings, and that his
name was on the door.</p>

<p>On the same day, Mrs. Gregory and Filby went to
the town hall to lay information before the magistrates;
but found them so busily engaged in dealing
with the excesses of the soldiers who were at that
time passing through Bath, that the information
could not be taken before August 14. Meanwhile,
the piece of <i>white</i> lace was lodged&mdash;at any rate, for
the night of August 8&mdash;at the house of a certain
printer named Gye.</p>

<p>The result of the magistrates' inquiry may be
discovered in <i>The Times</i> of August 20, where we
read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Lady of a Gentleman of Bath, possessed of
a good fortune, and respected by a numerous circle
of acquaintance, was committed on Thursday by
G. Chapman, Esq., the Mayor, to the County Gaol at
Ilchester, on a charge of privately stealing a card of
lace from a haberdasher's shop.</p></div>

<p>As Mrs. Perrot did not come up for trial until
the end of the following March, she had to undergo
a long and trying confinement. It appears that she
was not lodged actually in the gaol, but in some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
neighbouring house, kept by a man of the name of
Scadding.</p>

<p>The charge was a monstrous one; the accused had
ample means to indulge every wish, and nothing short
of lunacy (of which she never showed the slightest sign)
could have induced her to commit so petty a theft.
Her high character and the absence of motive combined
to render it incredible, and, had she been capable
of such a deed, she would not have courted detection
by walking quietly past the shop, a quarter of an hour
later, with the parcel in her hand. There were also
strong reasons for thinking that the accusation was
the result of a deep-laid plot. Gye, the printer, who
lived in the market-place, was believed to be the chief
instigator. His character was indifferent, and he had
money invested in Gregory's shop; and the business
was in so bad a way that there was a temptation
to seek for some large haul by way of blackmail.
Mrs. Leigh Perrot was selected as the victim, people
thought, because her husband was so extremely
devoted to her that he would be sure to do anything
to save her from the least vexation. If so, the conspirators
were mistaken in their man. Mr. Perrot
resolved to see the matter through, and, taking no
notice of the many suggestions as to hush-money that
were apparently circulated, engaged the best counsel
possible, secured his most influential acquaintance
as witnesses to his wife's character, and spent the
terrible intervening period in confinement with her
at Ilchester. He was well aware that the criminal
law of England, as it then existed, made the lot of
untried prisoners as hard, and the difficulty of proving
their innocence as great, as possible; he knew also
that in the seething disquiet of men's minds, brought
about by the French Revolution, it was quite possible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
they might encounter a jury anxious to cast discredit
on the well-to-do classes. He was therefore
prepared for a failure of justice; and, we are told,
had arranged that in case of an adverse verdict,
followed by transportation, he would sell his property
and accompany his wife across the seas.</p>

<p>Among the warmest supporters of the Leigh
Perrots was Mr. Morris&mdash;a lawyer of eminence, well
used to dealing with evidence, but now living as
an invalid at Bath. He was a total stranger to the
accused, but maintained most energetically that,
apart from her well-known character, the nature of
the evidence adduced against her would have been
sufficient to prove her innocence.</p>

<p>The amazement and indignation of the Steventon
party may be imagined. They were too sensible to
believe that so mean and objectless a crime should
really have been committed by a respectable woman&mdash;a
near relation of their own, whom they knew
intimately; but it was not easy to determine how
to show their sympathy. Mr. and Mrs. Austen seem
at last to have come (no doubt with their daughters'
good-will) to the momentous decision mentioned in
the following letter, which was addressed to Mrs. Leigh
Perrot on January 11, 1800, by her cousin, Montague
Cholmeley.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>You tell me that your good sister Austen has
offered you one or both of her daughters to
continue with you during your stay in that vile
place, but you decline the kind offer, as you cannot
procure them accommodation in the house with you,
and you cannot let those elegant young women be
your inmates in a prison, nor be subjected to the

<p>So Cassandra and Jane just escaped a residence

<p>Another letter written about this time must have
given much pleasure to the Leigh Perrots:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Honored Sir</span>,&mdash;You may have forgot your old
postillon Ben Dunford but I shall never forget yours
and my mistresses great goodness to me when I was
taken with the small pox in your sarvice. You sent
me very careful to mothers, and paid a nurse and my
doctor, and my board for a long time as I was bad,
and when I was too bad with biles all over my head
so as I could not go to sarvice for a many weeks you
maintained me. the famaly as I lives with be a
going thro' Bath into Devonshire and we stops two
days at the Inn and there I heard of the bad trick as
those bad shopkeepers has sarved my mistress and I
took the libarty of going to your house to enquire
how you both do and the housekeeper said she sent a
pasel to you every week and if I had anything to say
she could send a letter. I hope Honored Sir you will
forgive my taking such a libarty to write but I wish
anybody could tell me how to do you and mistress
any good. I would travel night and day to serve
you both. I be at all times with my humble duty

<p><small>James Leigh Perrot Esq.</small>
</p>
</div>
<p>The trial took place at Taunton on Saturday,
March 29. The old Castle Hall&mdash;where Judge Jeffreys
once sat on his 'Bloody Assizes'&mdash;said to be capable
of containing 2000 persons, was filled at an early
hour. So urgent was the curiosity, even of the
Bar, that the 'Nisi Prius' Court, which stood at
the opposite end of the hall, was not opened for
business that morning&mdash;all the counsel on the circuit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
surrounding the table of the Crown Bar; while the
rest of the hall was thronged with anxious spectators,
many hundreds of whom could not possibly have
heard a word that was said, and were almost crushed
to death and suffocated with heat. Between seven
and eight o'clock, Mrs. Leigh Perrot, who had been
conveyed from Ilchester, appeared in the dock,
attended by Mr. Leigh Perrot and three ladies, and
the proceedings commenced.</p>

<p>After the evidence for the prosecution was closed,
the prisoner was invited by the judge to make her
defence.</p>

<p>She attempted to address the Court; but, after
speaking a few sentences, became so much agitated
that her voice failed her; whereupon Mr. Jekyll, one
of her counsel, was requested to repeat to the Court
what she wished to address to them. She then
dictated as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>I am informed by my counsel, that they cannot
be permitted to offer any observations to you on my
case.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> The circumstances of it do not render it
necessary to detain you long. I shall therefore
take this opportunity of troubling you with a few
words.</p>

<p>Placed in a situation the most eligible that
any woman could desire, with supplies so ample that
I was left rich after every wish was gratified; blessed
in the affections of the most generous man as a
husband, what could induce me to commit such a
crime? Depraved indeed must that mind be that
under such circumstances could be so culpable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>You will hear from my noble and truly respectable
friends what has been my conduct and
character for a long series of years; you will hear
what has been, and what is now, their opinion of me.
Can you suppose that disposition so totally altered,
as to lose all recollection of the situation I held in
society&mdash;to hazard for this meanness my character
and reputation, or to endanger the health and peace
of mind of a husband whom I would die for?</p></div>

<p>Here her voice faltered; she seemed to be on
the point of fainting, and Mr. Leigh Perrot, who had
sustained all this trying scene with wonderful resolution,
put his handkerchief to his face and wept in
agony; many persons in Court, even amongst the
counsel, participating in his emotion.</p>

<p>The prisoner continued:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>You have heard their evidence against me.
I shall make no comment upon it&mdash;I shall leave that
task where I am certain it will be executed with justice
and mercy. I know my own oath in this case is
inadmissible, but I call upon that God whom we all
adore to attest that I am innocent of this charge,
and may He reward or punish me as I speak true or
false in denying it. I call that God to witness that
I did not know that I had the lace in my possession,
nor did I know it when Mrs. Gregory accosted me
in the street. I have nothing more to add.</p></div>

<p>Then followed the evidence for the prisoner, which
was chiefly evidence to character, and came from
persons occupying prominent positions who knew her
well, either at her Berkshire home or at Bath.</p>

<p>The judge's summing up occupied nearly an hour.
In it he said that it was impossible that any person
should have a higher character than the prisoner;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
but if the jury were satisfied with the evidence for
the prosecution and believed it, that character ought
not to avail her. If, however, upon taking all the
circumstances of the case into consideration, the
jury should see any reason to disbelieve the witnesses
for the prosecution, or which led them to doubt of
the prisoner's guilt, they should recollect the very
excellent character which had been given her, and in
that case it ought to bear great weight with them
towards an acquittal. He also alluded to the conduct
of the accused after leaving the shop as not being that
of a guilty person, and commented on the ease with
which she could have secreted the parcel before it
was discovered.</p>

<p>The jury evidently saw great reason to disbelieve
the witnesses for the prosecution, and, after only
fifteen<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> minutes, returned a verdict of 'Not
Guilty.'</p>

<p>The <i>Star</i> tells us that 'the trial lasted seven hours,
and the scene of the acquittal was extremely affecting;
the agitation and embraces of Mr. and Mrs.
Perrot may be more easily conceived than described.
The Court was crowded with elegantly dressed
women.'</p>

<p>Throughout the long months over which the affair
extended, the Leigh Perrots had acted as persons
convinced of the baselessness of the charge, and
determined to confront the accusers, and, as far as
the existing state of the law allowed, to establish
the innocence of the accused.</p>

<p>Among the quantity of congratulatory letters
received by Mr. Leigh Perrot, we must content
ourselves with quoting the following from Mr. R. L.
Edgeworth:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><div class='right'>Edgeworthstown, Ireland: [April 7, 1800.]
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I do not think that I ever felt
so much astonishment or indignation as at the
abominable transaction which was related in the
<i>Star</i> of March 31st.</p>

<p>Among my numerous friends and acquaintance,
if there was a couple whom I could have selected
as the farthest removed from being the objects of
such a villainous attack it would have been yourselves!
But I too well know, that neither perfect
innocence nor consummate prudence are sufficient
shields against conspiracy and folly, and that bankrupt
fortune and bankrupt character prepare men
for the most desperate attempts.</p>

<p>I trouble you, my Dear Sir, with a few lines to
express the deep sense that I have of regard and
esteem for you and the amiable partner of your
happiness; for so many as thirty-four years we have
been acquainted, and during that time I do not
think that I have met any man of such singularly
nice feelings of honour and justice.</p>

<p>I am sensible that there is some impropriety in
this address&mdash;but you must excuse it as I snatched
this piece of paper the moment I had read the paragraph
I allude to&mdash;and with tears of indignation
in my eyes&mdash;aye Sir!&mdash;with actual, not sentimental,
tears in my eyes I sat down to write to you.</p>

<p>Perhaps, after all, you are not the objects of this
transaction!</p>

<p>Even if that should be the fact you will pardon
me for renewing my claim to your remembrance and
for assuring you that you possess my esteem and
affection.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">Yours sincerely,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Richd Lovell Edgeworth.</span></div>

<p><small>James Leigh Perrot, Esq., Bath, England.</small></p>
</div>

<p>This strange and painful episode in the life of the
family was thus brought to a satisfactory ending.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
An accusation of petty and purposeless theft had
been made against a woman whose uprightness was
known to all those around her; a wife who enjoyed
(then and always) the absolute confidence of an
upright husband. It had been found baseless by a
jury after only a few minutes' deliberation; and the
Leigh Perrots had the pleasure of seeing the high
estimation in which they were held by their neighbours
exhibited in a strong light. This estimation
was to be theirs for the remainder of their lives,
extending in his case over seventeen, and in hers
over thirty-five years.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> For our particular purpose
the story seems worth narrating, because it shows
that the peaceful and well-ordered progress of Jane
Austen's life was not beyond the reach of tragic
possibilities. Indeed, at or near this time there were
three particular occurrences which, when taken
together, might well disturb the serenity and cheerfulness
of her mind, and indispose her for writing&mdash;especially
writing of a humorous character. One
of these events, which has already been recorded,
was her love story in the West; another was
Mrs. Leigh Perrot's trouble; and the third&mdash;the
loss of her old home&mdash;will form part of the subject
of the next two chapters.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>CHANGE OF HOME</h3>

<h3>1800-1801</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>Though</span> we can guess what was constantly occupying
the thoughts of the Austens in the autumn and
winter of 1799-1800, nothing remains to tell us how
they employed themselves during these anxious
months. Perhaps the sisters were at home, and
exchanged no letters; but had any been written,
we may be pretty sure they would be among
those destroyed by Cassandra. When we meet the
family again, in October 1800, we find that they
have returned to everyday life with its little
incidents, its duties, and its pleasures; that Edward
and his eldest son have lately left Steventon for
Godmersham, taking Cassandra with them, and
that Jane is remaining at home with her parents.</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'><br />Steventon: Saturday evening [October 25, 1800].
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cassandra</span>,&mdash; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You have had a very
pleasant journey of course, and have found Elizabeth
and all the children very well on your arrival at Godmersham,
and I congratulate you on it. Edward is
rejoicing this evening, I dare say, to find himself once
more at home, from which he fancies he has been
absent a great while. His son left behind him the very
fine chestnuts which had been selected for planting at
Godmersham, and the drawing of his own which he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
had intended to carry to George; the former will
therefore be deposited in the soil of Hampshire
instead of Kent, the latter I have already consigned
to another element.</p>

<p>We have been exceedingly busy ever since you went
away. In the first place we have had to rejoice two
or three times every day at your having such very
delightful weather for the whole of your journey, and
in the second place we have been obliged to take
advantage of the very delightful weather ourselves
by going to see almost all our neighbours.</p>

<p>On Thursday we walked to Deane, yesterday to
Oakley Hall and Oakley, and to-day to Deane again.
At Oakley Hall we did a great deal&mdash;eat some
sandwiches all over mustard, admired Mr. Bramston's
porter, and Mrs. Bramston's transparencies, and
gained a promise from the latter of two roots of
heartsease, one all yellow and the other all purple,
for you. At Oakley we bought ten pair of worsted
stockings and a shift; the shift is for Betty
Dawkins, as we find she wants it more than
a rug; she is one of the most grateful of all
whom Edward's charity has reached, or at least
she expresses herself more warmly than the rest,
for she sends him a 'sight of thanks.'</p>

<p>This morning we called at the Harwoods', and
in their dining-room found 'Heathcote and Chute<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
for ever'&mdash;Mrs. William Heathcote and Mrs. Chute&mdash;the
first of whom took a long ride yesterday morning
with Mrs. Harwood into Lord Carnarvon's park,
and fainted away in the evening, and the second
walked down from Oakley Hall attended by Mrs.
Augusta Bramston; they had meant to come on to
Steventon afterwards, but we knew a trick worth
two of that.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>James called by my father's desire on Mr. Bayle<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
to inquire into the cause of his being so horrid.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Mr. Bayle did not attempt to deny his being horrid,
and made many apologies for it; he did not plead
his having a drunken self, he talked only of a drunken
foreman, &amp;c., and gave hopes of the tables being at
Steventon on Monday se'nnight next. We have had
no letter since you left us, except one from Mr. Serle, of
Bishopstoke, to inquire the character of James Elton.</p>

<p><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;Our improvements have advanced
very well; the bank along the <i>elm walk</i> is sloped down
for the reception of thorns and lilacs, and it is settled
that the other side of the path is to continue turfed,
and to be planted with beech, ash, and larch.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Steventon: Saturday [November 1, 1800].
</div>

<p>You have written, I am sure, though I have
received no letter from you since your leaving
London; the post, and not yourself, must have been
unpunctual.</p>

<p>We have at last heard from Frank; a letter came
from him to you yesterday, and I mean to send it
on as soon as I can get a ditto (<i>that</i> means a frank),
which I hope to do in a day or two. <i>En attendant</i>,
you must rest satisfied with knowing that on the 8th
of July the <i>Peterel</i> with the rest of the Egyptian
squadron was off the Isle of Cyprus, whither they
went from Jaffa for provisions, &amp;c., and whence
they were to sail in a day or two for Alexandria,
there to wait the result of the English proposals for
the evacuation of Egypt. The rest of the letter,
according to the present fashionable style of composition,
is chiefly descriptive. Of his promotion he
knows nothing; of prizes he is guiltless.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Did you think of our ball [probably at Basingstoke]
on Thursday evening, and did you suppose me
at it? You might very safely, for there I was. On
Wednesday morning it was settled that Mrs. Harwood,
Mary, and I should go together, and shortly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
afterwards a very civil note of invitation for me
came from Mrs. Bramston, who wrote I believe as
soon as she knew of the ball. I might likewise have
gone with Mrs. Lefroy, and therefore, with three
methods of going, I must have been more at the
ball than anyone else. I dined and slept at Deane;
Charlotte and I did my hair, which I fancy looked
very indifferent; nobody abused it, however, and I
retired delighted with my success.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant ball, and still more good than
pleasant, for there were nearly sixty people, and
sometimes we had seventeen couple. The Portsmouths,
Dorchesters, Boltons, Portals, and Clerks
were there, and all the meaner and more usual &amp;c.,
&amp;c.'s. There was a scarcity of men in general, and
a still greater scarcity of any that were good for
much. I danced nine dances out of ten&mdash;five with
Stephen Terry, T. Chute, and James Digweed, and
four with Catherine.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> There was commonly a couple
of ladies standing up together, but not often any so
amiable as ourselves.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>You were inquired after very prettily, and I hope
the whole assembly now understands that you are
gone into Kent, which the families in general seemed
to meet in ignorance of. Lord Portsmouth surpassed
the rest in his attentive recollection of you, inquired
more into the length of your absence, and concluded
by desiring to be 'remembered to you when I wrote
next.'</p>

<p>Lady Portsmouth had got a different dress on,
and Lady Bolton is much improved by a wig. The
three Miss Terries were there, but no Annie; which
was a great disappointment to me. I hope the poor
girl had not set her heart on her appearance that
evening so much as I had. Mr. Terry is ill, in a very
low way. I said civil things for Edward to Mr.
Chute, who amply returned them by declaring that,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
had he known of my brother's being at Steventon,
he should have made a point of calling upon him
to thank him for his civility about the Hunt.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Steventon: Saturday evening [November 8, 1800].<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
</div>

<p>Having just finished <i>Les Veill&eacute;es du Ch&acirc;teau</i>
I think it a good opportunity for beginning a letter
to you while my mind is stored with ideas worth
transmitting.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I thank you for so speedy a return to my two
last, and particularly thank you for your anecdote
of Charlotte Graham and her cousin, Harriet Bailey,
which has very much amused both my mother and
myself. If you can learn anything farther of that
interesting affair, I hope you will mention it. I have
two messages; let me get rid of them, and then my
paper will be my own. Mary fully intended writing
to you by Mr. Chute's frank, and only happened
entirely to forget it, but will write soon; and my
father wishes Edward to send him a memorandum in
your next letter of the price of the hops. The tables
are come, and give general contentment. I had not
expected that they would so perfectly suit the fancy
of us all three, or that we should so well agree in the
disposition of them; but nothing except their own
surface can have been smoother. The two ends put
together form one constant table for everything, and
the centre piece stands exceedingly well under the
glass, and holds a great deal most commodiously,
without looking awkwardly. They are both covered
with green baize, and send their best love. The Pembroke
has got its destination by the sideboard, and
my mother has great delight in keeping her money and
papers locked up. The little table which used to stand
there has most conveniently taken itself off into the
best bedroom; and we are now in want only of the
chiffonniere, which is neither finished nor come. So<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
much for that subject; I now come to another,
of a very different nature, as other subjects are very
apt to be. Earle Harwood has been again giving
uneasiness to his family and talk to the neighbourhood;
in the present instance, however, he is only
unfortunate, and not in fault.</p>

<p>About ten days ago, in cocking a pistol in the
guard-room at Marcau (?) he accidentally shot himself
through the thigh. Two young Scotch surgeons in
the island were polite enough to propose taking off
the thigh at once, but to that he would not consent;
and accordingly in his wounded state was put on
board a cutter and conveyed to Haslar Hospital, at
Gosport, where the bullet was extracted, and where
he now is, I hope, in a fair way of doing well. The
surgeon of the hospital wrote to the family on the
occasion, and John Harwood went down to him immediately,
attended by James,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> whose object in going
was to be the means of bringing back the earliest
intelligence to Mr. and Mrs. Harwood, whose anxious
sufferings, particularly those of the latter, have of
course been dreadful. They went down on Tuesday,
and James came back the next day, bringing such
favourable accounts as greatly to lessen the distress of
the family at Deane, though it will probably be a long
while before Mrs. Harwood can be quite at ease. <i>One</i>
most material comfort, however, they have: the
assurance of its being really an accidental wound,
which is not only positively declared by Earle himself,
but is likewise testified by the particular direction
of the bullet. Such a wound could not have been
received in a duel. At present he is going on very
well, but the surgeon will not declare him to be in no
danger.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. James had not time at Gosport to
take any other steps towards seeing Charles, than
the very few which conducted him to the door of the
assembly room in the Inn, where there happened to
be a Ball on the night of their arrival;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span> a likely spot
enough for the discovery of a Charles: but I am glad
to say that he was not of the party, for it was in
general a very ungenteel one, and there was hardly
a pretty girl in the room.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Yesterday was a day of great business with me;
Mary drove me all in the rain to Basingstoke, and
still more all in the rain back again, because it rained
harder; and soon after our return to Deane a sudden
invitation and an own postchaise took us to Ashe
Park to dine <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with Mr. Holder, Mr. Gauntlet,
and James Digweed; but our <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> was cruelly
reduced by the non-attendance of the two latter.
We had a very quiet evening. I believe Mary found
it dull, but I thought it very pleasant. To sit in idleness
over a good fire in a well-proportioned room is a
luxurious sensation. Sometimes we talked, and sometimes
we were quite silent; I said two or three amusing
things, and Mr. Holder made a few infamous puns.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Mr. Heathcote met with a genteel little accident
the other day in hunting; he got off to lead his horse
over a hedge, or a house, or something, and his horse
in his haste trod upon his leg, or rather ancle, I believe,
and it is not certain whether the small bone is not
broke.</p>

<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Martha has accepted Mary's invitation for
Lord Portsmouth's ball. He has not yet sent out
his <i>own</i> invitations, but <i>that</i> does not signify; Martha
comes, and a ball there must be. I think it will be
too early in her mother's absence for me to return
with her.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>Sunday Evening.</i>&mdash;We have had a dreadful storm
of wind in the fore part of this day, which has done a
great deal of mischief among our trees. I was sitting
alone in the dining-room when an odd kind of crash
startled me&mdash;in a moment afterwards it was repeated;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
descend into the Sweep!!!!! The other, which had
fallen, I suppose, in the first crash, and which was the
nearest to the pond, taking a more easterly direction,
sunk among our screen of chestnuts and firs, knocking
down one spruce-fir, beating off the head of another,
and stripping the two corner chestnuts of several
branches in its fall. This is not all. One large
elm out of the two on the left-hand side as you
enter what I call the elm walk, was likewise blown
down; the maypole bearing the weathercock was
broke in two, and what I regret more than all the
rest is, that all the three elms which grew in Hall's
meadow, and gave such ornament to it, are gone; two
were blown down, and the other so much injured that
it cannot stand. I am happy to add, however, that
no greater evil than the loss of trees has been the consequence
of the storm in this place, or in our immediate
neighbourhood. We grieve, therefore, in some comfort.</p>

<p>Mr. Holder's paper tells us that some time in last
August Captain Austen and the <i>Peterel</i> were very
active in securing a Turkish ship (driven into Port in
Cyprus by bad weather) from the French. He was
forced to burn her, however.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">I am yours ever,</span><br />

J. A.
</div></div>

<p>Next in order comes a letter to Martha Lloyd:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'><br />Steventon: Wednesday evening [November 12, 1800].<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Martha</span>,&mdash;I did not receive your note
yesterday till after Charlotte had left Deane, or I
would have sent my answer by her, instead of being
the means, as I now must be, of lessening the elegance
of your new dress for the Hurstbourne ball by the
value of 3<i>d.</i> You are very good in wishing to see
me at Ibthorp so soon, and I am equally good in
wishing to come to you. I believe our merit in that
respect is much upon a par, our self-denial mutually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
strong. Having paid this tribute of praise to the
virtue of both, I shall here have done with panegyric,
and proceed to plain matter of fact. In about a
fortnight's time I hope to be with you. I have two
reasons for not being able to come before. I wish
so to arrange my visit as to spend some days with you
after your mother's return. In the 1st place, that I
may have the pleasure of seeing her, and in the 2nd,
that I may have a better chance of bringing you back
with me. Your promise in my favour was not quite
absolute, but if your will is not perverse, you and I
will do all in our power to overcome your scruples of
conscience. I hope we shall meet next week to talk
all this over, till we have tired ourselves with the
very idea of my visit before my visit begins. Our
invitations for the 19th are arrived, and very curiously
are they worded.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Mary mentioned to you yesterday
poor Earle's unfortunate accident, I dare say. He
does not seem to be going on very well. The two
or three last posts have brought less and less favourable
accounts of him. John Harwood has gone to
Gosport again to-day. We have two families of
friends now who are in a most anxious state; for
though by a note from Catherine this morning there
seems now to be a revival of hope at Manydown, its
continuance may be too reasonably doubted. Mr.
Heathcote, however, who has broken the small bone
of his leg, is so good as to be going on very well.
It would be really too much to have three people to
care for.</p>

<p>You distress me cruelly by your request about
books. I cannot think of any to bring with me, nor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
have I any idea of our wanting them. I come to you
to be talked to, not to read or hear reading; I can do
that at home; and indeed I am now laying in a stock
of intelligence to pour out on you as my share of
the conversation. I am reading Henry's <i>History of
England</i>, which I will repeat to you in any manner you
may prefer, either in a loose, desultory, unconnected
stream, or dividing my recital, as the historian divides
it himself, into seven parts:&mdash;The Civil and Military:
Religion: Constitution: Learning and Learned Men:
Arts and Sciences: Commerce, Coins, and Shipping:
and Manners. So that for every evening in the week
there will be a different subject. The Friday's lot&mdash;Commerce,
Coins, and Shipping&mdash;you will find the
least entertaining; but the next evening's portion
will make amends. With such a provision on my
part, if you will do yours by repeating the French
Grammar, and Mrs. Stent<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> will now and then ejaculate
some wonder about the cocks and hens, what can we
want? Farewell for a short time. We all unite in
best love, and I am your very affectionate</p>

<p>The Hurstbourne ball took place on November
19, and was graced by the presence of Lieutenant
Charles Austen. He had distinguished himself on
the <i>Endymion</i>, especially in the capture of the
<i>Scipio</i> in a heavy gale. His ship was now at
Portsmouth waiting for orders.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'><br />Steventon: Thursday [November 20, 1800].
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cassandra</span>,&mdash;Your letter took me quite
by surprise this morning; you are very welcome,
however, and I am very much obliged to you. I
believe I drank too much wine last night at Hurstbourne;
I know not how else to account for the
shaking of my hand to-day. You will kindly make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
allowance therefore for any indistinctness of writing,
by attributing it to this venial error.</p>

<p>Naughty Charles did not come on Tuesday, but
good Charles came yesterday morning. About two
o'clock he walked in on a Gosport hack. His feeling
equal to such a fatigue is a good sign, and his feeling
no fatigue in it a still better. He walked down to
Deane to dinner; he danced the whole evening, and
to-day is no more tired than a gentleman ought
to be.</p>

<p>Your desire to hear from me on Sunday will,
perhaps, bring you a more particular account of the
ball than you may care for, because one is prone to
think much more of such things the morning after
they happen, than when time has entirely driven
them out of one's recollection.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant evening; Charles found it
remarkably so, but I cannot tell why, unless the
absence of Miss Terry, towards whom his conscience
reproaches him with being now perfectly indifferent,
was a relief to him. There were only twelve dances,
of which I danced nine, and was merely prevented
from dancing the rest by the want of a partner. We
began at ten, supped at one, and were at Deane
before five. There were but fifty people in the room;
very few families indeed from our side of the county,
and not many more from the other. My partners
were the two St. Johns, Hooper, Holder, and very
prodigious Mr. Mathew, with whom I called<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> the
last, and whom I liked the best of my little stock.</p>

<p>There were very few beauties, and such as there
were not very handsome. Miss Iremonger did not
look well, and Mrs. Blount was the only one much
admired. She appeared exactly as she did in September,
with the same broad face, diamond bandeau,
white shoes, pink husband, and fat neck. The two
Miss Coxes were there; I traced in one the remains<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
of the vulgar, broad-featured girl who danced at
Enham eight years ago; the other is refined into a
nice, composed-looking girl, like Catherine Bigg. I
looked at Sir Thomas Champneys and thought of
poor Rosalie; I looked at his daughter, and thought
her a queer animal with a white neck.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Mary said that I looked very well last night. I
wore my aunt's gown and handkerchief, and my hair
was at least tidy, which was all my ambition. I
will now have done with the ball, and I will moreover
go and dress for dinner.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The young lady whom it is expected that Sir
Thomas<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> is to marry is Miss Emma Wabshaw; she
lives somewhere between Southampton and Winchester,
is handsome, accomplished, amiable, and
everything but rich. He is certainly finishing his
house in a great hurry. Perhaps the report of his
being to marry a Miss Fanshawe might originate in
his attentions to this very lady&mdash;the names are not
unlike.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The three Digweeds all came on Tuesday, and we
played a pool at commerce. James Digweed left
Hampshire to-day. I think he must be in love with
you, from his anxiety to have you go to the Faversham
balls, and likewise from his supposition that
the two elms fell from their grief at your absence.
Was not it a gallant idea? It never occurred to me
before, but I dare say it was so.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I rejoice to say that we have just had another
letter from our dear Frank. It is to you, very short,
written from Larnica in Cyprus, and so lately as
October 2nd. He came from Alexandria, and was
to return there in three or four days, knew nothing of
his promotion, and does not write above twenty lines,
from a doubt of the letter's ever reaching you, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
an idea of all letters being opened at Vienna. He
wrote a few days before to you from Alexandria by
the <i>Mercury</i> sent with despatches to Lord Keith.
Another letter must be owing to us besides this, <i>one</i>
if not <i>two;</i> because none of these are to me. Henry
comes to-morrow, for one night only.</p></div>

<p>The visit to Ibthorp came off, as is shown by the
following letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'><br />Ibthorp: Sunday [November 30, 1800].<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cassandra</span>,&mdash;Shall you expect to hear
from me on Wednesday or not? I think you will,
or I should not write, as the three days and half
which have passed since my last letter have not
produced many materials towards filling another
sheet of paper. But, like Mr. Hastings, 'I do not
despair,' and you perhaps, like the faithful Maria,
may feel still more certain of the happy event. I
have been here ever since a quarter after three on
Thursday last, by the Shrewsbury clock, which I am
fortunately enabled absolutely to ascertain because
Mrs. Stent once lived at Shrewsbury, or at least at
Tewksbury. I have the pleasure of thinking myself
a very welcome guest, and the pleasure of spending
my time very pleasantly. Martha looks well, and
wants me to find out that she grows fat; but I
cannot carry my complaisance farther than to
believe whatever she asserts on the subject. Mrs.
Stent gives us quite as much of her company as we
wish for, and rather more than she used to do; but
perhaps not more than is to our advantage in the
end, because it is too dirty even for such desperate
walkers as Martha and I to get out of doors, and we
are therefore confined to each other's society from
morning till night, with very little variety of books
or gowns. Three of the Miss Debaries<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> called here
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>the morning after my arrival, but I have not yet
been able to return their civility. You know it is
not an uncommon circumstance in this parish to
have the road from Ibthorp to the Parsonage much
dirtier and more impracticable for walking than the
road from the Parsonage to Ibthorp. I left my
Mother very well when I came away, and left her
with strict orders to continue so.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The endless Debaries are of course very well
acquainted with the lady who is to marry Sir Thomas,
and all her family. I pardon them, however, as their
description of her is favourable. Mrs. Wapshire is
a widow, with several sons and daughters, a good
fortune, and a house in Salisbury; where Miss Wapshire
has been for many years a distinguished beauty.
She is now seven or eight and twenty, and tho' still
handsome, less handsome than she has been. This
promises better than the bloom of seventeen; and
in addition to this they say that she has always
been remarkable for the propriety of her behaviour
distinguishing her far above the general classes
of town misses, and rendering her of course very
unpopular among them.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Martha has promised to return with me, and our
plan is to have a nice black frost for walking to
Whitchurch, and then throw ourselves into a post
chaise, one upon the other, our heads hanging out at
one door and our feet at the opposite one. If you
have never heard that Miss Dawes has been married
these two months, I will mention it in my next.
Pray do not forget to go to the Canterbury Ball;
I shall despise you all most insufferably if you do.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I have charged my myrmidons to send me an
account of the Basingstoke Ball; I have placed my
spies at different places that they may collect the
more; and by so doing, by sending Miss Bigg to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Town-hall<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> itself, and posting my mother at Steventon
I hope to derive from their various observations a
good general idea of the whole.</p>

<p>While Jane was away on this visit, Mr. and Mrs.
Austen came to a momentous decision&mdash;namely, to
leave Steventon and retire to Bath. There can be
little doubt that the decision was a hasty one. Some
of Jane's previous letters contain details of the very
considerable improvements that her father had just
begun in the Rectory garden; and we do not hear
that these improvements were concerted with the
son who was to be his successor. So hasty, indeed,
did Mr. Austen's decision appear to the Perrots that
they suspected the reason to be a growing attachment
between Jane and one of the three Digweed
brothers. There is not the slightest evidence of this
very improbable supposition in Jane's letters, though
she <i>does</i> occasionally suggest that James Digweed
must be in love with Cassandra, especially when he
gallantly supposed that the two elms had fallen from
grief at her absence. On the whole it seems most
probable that Mrs. Austen's continued ill-health was
the reason for the change.</p>

<p>Tradition says that when Jane returned home
accompanied by Martha Lloyd, the news was abruptly
announced by her mother, who thus greeted them:
'Well, girls, it is all settled; we have decided to
leave Steventon in such a week, and go to Bath';
and that the shock of the intelligence was so great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
to Jane that she fainted away. Unfortunately, there
is no further direct evidence to show how far Jane's
feelings resembled those she has attributed to Marianne
Dashwood on leaving Norland; but we have
the negative evidence arising from the fact that none
of her letters are preserved between November 30,
1800, and January 3, 1801, although Cassandra was
at Godmersham during the whole of the intervening
month. Silence on the part of Jane to Cassandra for so
long a period of absence is unheard of: and according
to the rule acted on by Cassandra, destruction of
her sister's letters was a proof of their emotional
interest. We cannot doubt, therefore, that she wrote
in a strain unusual for her more than once in that
month; but as she says of Elizabeth Bennet 'it
was her business to be satisfied&mdash;and certainly her
temper to be happy'; and the next letter that we
have shows that she was determined to face a new
life in a new place with cheerfulness.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'><br />Steventon: Saturday [January 3, 1801].
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cassandra</span>,.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&mdash;My mother looks
forward with as much certainty as you can do to our
keeping two maids; my father is the only one not in
the secret. We plan having a steady cook and a young,
giddy housemaid, with a sedate middle-aged man,
who is to undertake the double office of husband to
the former and sweetheart to the latter.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>There are three parts of Bath which we have
thought of as likely to have houses in them&mdash;Westgate
Buildings, Charles Street, and some of the short
streets leading from Laura Place or Pulteney Street.</p>

<p>Westgate Buildings, though quite in the lower
part of the town, are not badly situated themselves.
The street is broad, and has rather a good appearance.
Charles Street, however, I think is preferable. The
buildings are new, and its nearness to Kingsmead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Fields would be a pleasant circumstance. Perhaps
you may remember, or perhaps you may forget, that
Charles Street leads from the Queen Square Chapel
to the two Green Park Streets.</p>

<p>The houses in the streets near Laura Place I
should expect to be above our price. Gay Street
would be too high, except only the lower house on
the left-hand side as you ascend. Towards that my
mother has no disinclination; it used to be lower
rented than any other house in the row, from some
inferiority in the apartments. But above all others
her wishes are at present fixed on the corner house
in Chapel Row, which opens into Prince's Street.
Her knowledge of it, however, is confined only to
the outside, and therefore she is equally uncertain
of its being really desirable as of its being to be
had. In the meantime she assures you that she
will do everything in her power to avoid Trim
Street, although you have not expressed the fearful
presentiment of it which was rather expected.</p>

<p>We know that Mrs. Perrot will want to get us
into Oxford Buildings,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> but we all unite in particular
dislike of that part of the town, and therefore hope
to escape. Upon all these different situations you
and Edward may confer together, and your opinion
of each will be expected with eagerness.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I have now attained the true art of letter-writing,
which we are always told is to express on paper
exactly what one would say to the same person by
word of mouth. I have been talking to you almost
as fast as I could the whole of this letter.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>My mother bargains for having no trouble at all
in furnishing our house in Bath, and I have engaged
for your willingly undertaking to do it all. I get more
and more reconciled to the idea of our removal. We
have lived long enough in this neighbourhood; the
Basingstoke balls are certainly on the decline, there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
is something interesting in the bustle of going away,
and the prospect of spending future summers by the
sea or in Wales is very delightful. For a time we
shall now possess many of the advantages which I
have often thought of with envy in the wives of
sailors or soldiers. It must not be generally known,
however, that I am not sacrificing a great deal in
quitting the country, or I can expect to inspire no
tenderness, no interest, in those we leave behind.</p>

<p>The threatened Act of Parliament does not seem
to give any alarm.</p>

<p>My father is doing all in his power to increase his
income, by raising his tithes, &amp;c., and I do not
despair of getting very nearly six hundred a year.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Steventon: Thursday [January 8, 1801].
</div>

<p>Mr. Peter Debary has declined Deane curacy;
he wishes to be settled near London. A foolish
reason! as if Deane were not near London in comparison
of Exeter or York. Take the whole world
through, and he will find many more places at a
greater distance from London than Deane than he
will at a less. What does he think of Glencoe or
Lake Katherine?</p>

<p>I feel rather indignant that any possible objection
should be raised against so valuable a piece of preferment,
so delightful a situation!&mdash;that Deane should
not be universally allowed to be as near the metropolis
as any other country villages. As this is the
case, however, as Mr. Peter Debary has shown himself
a Peter in the blackest sense of the word, we are
obliged to look elsewhere for an heir; and my father
has thought it a necessary compliment to James
Digweed to offer the curacy to him, though without
considering it as either a desirable or an eligible
situation for him.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Eliza has seen Lord Craven at Barton, and
probably by this time at Kintbury, where he was
expected for one day this week. She found his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
manners very pleasing indeed. The little flaw of
having a mistress now living with him at Ashdown
Park seems to be the only unpleasing circumstance
about him. From Ibthorp, Fulwar and Eliza are
to return with James and Mary to Deane.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Pray give my love to George; tell him that I am
very glad to hear he can skip so well already, and
that I hope he will continue to send me word of his
improvement in the art.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Sidmouth is now talked of as our
summer abode. Get all the information, therefore,
about it that you can from Mrs. C. Cage.</p>

<p>My father's old ministers are already deserting
him to pay their court to his son. The brown mare,
which as well as the black, was to devolve on James
at our removal, has not had patience to wait for that,
and has settled herself even now at Deane. The
death of Hugh Capet, which, like that of Mr. Skipsey,
though undesired, was not wholly unexpected, being
purposely effected, has made the immediate possession
of the mare very convenient, and everything else I
suppose will be seized by degrees in the same manner.
Martha and I work at the books every day.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Steventon: Wednesday [January 14, 1801].
</div>

<p>Your letter to Mary was duly received before she
left Deane with Martha yesterday morning, and it
gives us great pleasure to know that the Chilham ball
was so agreeable, and that you danced four dances
with Mr. Kemble. Desirable, however, as the latter
circumstance was, I cannot help wondering at its
taking place. Why did you dance four dances with
so stupid a man? why not rather dance two of them
with some elegant brother officer who was struck
with your appearance as soon as you entered the
room?</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>At present the environs of Laura Place seem to
be his [my father's] choice. His views on the subject<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
are much advanced since I came home; he grows
quite ambitious, and actually requires now a comfortable
and a creditable-looking house.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>This morning brought my aunt's reply, and most
thoroughly affectionate is its tenor. She thinks
with the greatest pleasure of our being settled in
Bath&mdash;it is an event which will attach her to the
place more than anything else could do, &amp;c., &amp;c.
She is, moreover, very urgent with my mother not
to delay her visit in Paragon, if she should continue
unwell, and even recommends her spending the whole
winter with them. At present and for many days
past my mother has been quite stout, and she
wishes not to be obliged by any relapse to alter her
arrangements.</p></div>

<p>Mention is made in several letters of Frank's
promotion and his ignorance of it. In 1799, while
commanding the sloop <i>Peterel</i>, he had been entrusted
by Lord St. Vincent with dispatches conveying to
Nelson at Palermo the startling news of Admiral
Bruix's escape from Brest with a considerable fleet,
and his entry into the Mediterranean. So important
did Francis Austen believe this intelligence to be, that
he landed his first lieutenant with the dispatches
on the coast of Sicily some way short of Palermo,
the wind being unfavourable for the approach to the
capital by sea. Nelson next employed him in taking
orders to the squadron blockading Malta. Frank
spent the autumn and winter cruising about the
Mediterranean, and taking various prizes; the most
important capture being that of the <i>Ligurienne</i>&mdash;a
French national brig convoying two vessels laden
with corn for the French forces in Egypt. This
exploit took place in March 1800, and was considered
of such importance that he was made a post-captain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
for it; but so slow and uncertain was communication
to and from the seat of war that he knew nothing of
his promotion till October&mdash;long after his friends at
home had become acquainted with it. His being
'collared and thrust out of the <i>Peterel</i> by Captain
Inglis' (his successor) is of course a graphic way of
describing his change of vessel and promotion.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'><br />Steventon: Wednesday [January 21, 1801].
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cassandra</span>,&mdash;Expect a most agreeable
letter, for not being overburdened with subject
(having nothing at all to say), I shall have no check
to my genius from beginning to end.</p>

<p>Well, and so Frank's letter has made you very
happy, but you are afraid he would not have patience
to stay for the <i>Haarlem</i> which you wish him to
have done as being safer than the merchantman.
Poor fellow! to wait from the middle of November
to the end of December, and perhaps even longer,
it must be sad work; especially in a place where the
ink is so abominably pale. What a surprise to him
it must have been on October 20, to be visited,
collared, and thrust out of the <i>Peterel</i> by Captain
Inglis. He kindly passes over the poignancy of his
feelings in quitting his ship, his officers, and his men.</p>

<p>What a pity it is that he should not be in England
at the time of his promotion, because he certainly
would have had an appointment, so everybody says,
and therefore it must be right for me to say it too.
Had he been really here, the certainty of the
appointment, I dare say, would not have been
half so great, but as it could not be brought to
the proof his absence will be always a lucky source
of regret.</p>

<p>Eliza<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> talks of having read in a newspaper that all
the First Lieutenants of the frigates whose Captains
were to be sent into line-of-battle ships were to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
promoted to the rank of Commanders. If it be true,
Mr. Valentine may afford himself a fine Valentine's
knot, and Charles may perhaps become First of the
<i>Endymion</i>, though I suppose Captain Durham is
too likely to bring a villain with him under that
denomination.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I join with you in wishing for the environs of
Laura Place, but do not venture to expect it. My
mother hankers after the Square dreadfully, and it
is but natural to suppose that my uncle will take
<i>her</i> part. It would be very pleasant to be near
Sydney Gardens; we might go into the labyrinth
every day.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Steventon: Sunday [January 25, 1801].
</div>

<p>Your unfortunate sister was betrayed last Thursday
into a situation of the utmost cruelty. I arrived
at Ashe Park before the party from Deane, and was
shut up in the drawing-room with Mr. Holder alone
for ten minutes. I had some thoughts of insisting on
the housekeeper or Mary Corbett being sent for, and
nothing could prevail on me to move two steps from
the door, on the lock of which I kept one hand
constantly fixed. We met nobody but ourselves,
played at <i>vingt-un</i> again, and were very cross.</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class="blockquot"><p>Your brother Edward makes very honourable
mention of you, I assure you, in his letter to James,
and seems quite sorry to part with you. It is a great
comfort to me to think that my cares have not been
thrown away, and that you are respected in the world.
Perhaps you may be prevailed on to return with him
and Elizabeth into Kent, when they leave us in April,
and I rather suspect that your great wish of keeping
yourself disengaged has been with that view. Do
as you like; I have overcome my desire of your going
to Bath with my mother and me. There is nothing
which energy will not bring one to.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p></div>

<p>On her way back from Godmersham, Cassandra
spent some time with the Henry Austens now in Upper
Berkeley Street; and while she was there, Jane sent
her a letter, of which the following was a part.
Information respecting the sailor brothers on active
service was always rare, and proportionately valuable.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cassandra</span>,&mdash; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I should not have
thought it necessary to write to you so soon, but for
the arrival of a letter from Charles to myself. It
was written last Saturday from off the Start, and
conveyed to Popham Lane by Captain Boyle, on his
way to Midgham. He came from Lisbon in the
<i>Endymion</i>. I will copy Charles's account of his
conjectures about Frank: 'He has not seen my
brother lately, nor does he expect to find him
arrived, as he met Captain Inglis at Rhodes, going
up to take command of the <i>Peterel</i> as he was coming
down; but supposes he will arrive in less than a
fortnight from this time, in some ship which is expected
to reach England about that time with
despatches from Sir Ralph Abercrombie.' The event
must show what sort of a conjuror Captain Boyle is.
The <i>Endymion</i> has not been plagued with any more
prizes. Charles spent three pleasant days in Lisbon.</p>

<p>They were very well satisfied with their royal
passenger<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> whom they found jolly, fat, and affable,
who talks of Lady Augusta as his wife, and seems
much attached to her.</p>

<p>When this letter was written the <i>Endymion</i> was
becalmed, but Charles hoped to reach Portsmouth
by Monday or Tuesday.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He received my letter,
communicating our plans, before he left England,
was much surprised, of course, but is quite reconciled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
to them, and means to come to Steventon once more
while Steventon is ours.</p></div>

<p>After this, we have no letters of Jane till she
wrote from Bath; so we may suppose that the sisters
were soon united. The months of March and April
were spent in making the final preparations for
leaving Steventon, and in receiving farewell visits
from Edward Austen and his wife, as well as from
Frank and Charles and Martha Lloyd. At the beginning
of May, Mrs. Austen and her two daughters
left their old home and went to Ibthorp; two days
later, leaving Cassandra behind them, Jane and her
mother went in a single day from Ibthorp to Bath,
where they stayed with the Leigh Perrots in Paragon
Buildings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>BATH AGAIN</h3>

<h3>1801-1805</h3>


<p>In the separation of Jane and Cassandra, the letters
begin again.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'><br />Paragon: Tuesday [May 5, 1801].
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cassandra</span>,&mdash; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Our journey here was
perfectly free from accident or event; we changed
horses at the end of every stage, and paid at almost
every turnpike. We had charming weather, hardly
any dust, and were exceedingly agreeable, as we did
not speak above once in three miles.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>We had a very neat chaise from Devizes; it
looked almost as well as a gentleman's, at least as
a very shabby gentleman's; in spite of this advantage,
however, we were above three hours coming
from thence to Paragon, and it was half after seven
by your clocks before we entered the house.</p>

<p>Frank, whose black head was in waiting in the
hall window, received us very kindly; and his
master and mistress did not show less cordiality.
They both look very well, though my aunt has a
violent cough. We drank tea as soon as we arrived,
and so ends the account of our journey, which my
mother bore without any fatigue.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>There is to be only one more ball&mdash;next Monday
is the day. The Chamberlaynes are still here.
I begin to think better of Mrs. C., and upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
recollection believe she has rather a long chin than
otherwise, as she remembers us in Gloucestershire,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
when we were very charming young women.</p>

<p>The first view of Bath in fine weather does not
answer my expectations; I think I see more distinctly
through rain. The sun was got behind
everything, and the appearance of the place from
the top of Kingsdown was all vapour, shadow,
smoke, and confusion.</p>

<p>I fancy we are to have a house in Seymour Street,
or thereabouts. My uncle and aunt both like the
situation. I was glad to hear the former talk of all
the houses in New King Street as too small; it was
my own idea of them. I had not been two minutes
in the dining-room before he questioned me with all
his accustomary eager interest about Frank and
Charles, their views and intentions. I did my best
to give information.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>Tuesday Night.</i>&mdash;When my uncle went to take
his second glass of water I walked with him, and in
our morning's circuit we looked at two houses in
Green Park Buildings, one of which pleased me very
well. We walked all over it except into the garret;
the dining-room is of a comfortable size, just as
large as you like to fancy it; the second room about
14ft. square. The apartment over the drawing-room
pleased me particularly, because it is divided into
two, the smaller one a very nice-sized dressing-room,
which upon occasion might admit a bed.
The aspect is south-east. The only doubt is about
the dampness of the offices, of which there were
symptoms.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Paragon: Tuesday [May 12, 1801].
</div>

<p>Sixty-one guineas and a-half for the three cows
gives one some support under the blow of only eleven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
guineas for the tables. Eight for my pianoforte is
about what I really expected to get; I am more
anxious to know the amount of my books, especially
as they are said to have sold well.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In the evening, I hope you honoured my toilette
and ball with a thought; I dressed myself as well
as I could, and had all my finery much admired
at home. By nine o'clock my uncle, aunt, and I
entered the rooms, and linked Miss Winstone on to
us. Before tea it was rather a dull affair; but then
the before tea did not last long, for there was only one
dance, danced by four couple. Think of four couple,
surrounded by about an hundred people, dancing in
the Upper Rooms at Bath.</p>

<p>After tea we <i>cheered up;</i> the breaking up of
private parties sent some scores more to the ball,
and though it was shockingly and inhumanly thin
for this place, there were people enough, I suppose,
to have made five or six very pretty Basingstoke
assemblies.</p>

<p>I then got Mr. Evelyn to talk to, and Miss T.
to look at; and I am proud to say that though
repeatedly assured that another in the same party
was the <i>She</i>, I fixed upon the right one from the first.
A resemblance to Mrs. L. was my guide. She is not
so pretty as I expected; her face has the same
defect of baldness as her sister's, and her features not
so handsome; she was highly rouged, and looked
rather quietly and contentedly silly than anything else.</p>

<p>Mrs. B. and two young women were of the same
party, except when Mrs. B. thought herself obliged
to leave them to run round the room after her
drunken husband. His avoidance, and her pursuit,
with the probable intoxication of both, was an
amusing scene.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Another stupid party last night;
perhaps if larger they might be less intolerable,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
but here there were only just enough to make one
card table, with six people to look on and talk
nonsense to each other. Lady Fust, Mrs. Busby,
and a Mrs. Owen sat down with my uncle to whist,
within five minutes after the three old <i>Toughs</i> came
in, and there they sat, with only the exchange of
Adm. Stanhope for my uncle, till their chairs were
announced.</p>

<p>I cannot anyhow continue to find people agreeable;
I respect Mrs. Chamberlayne for doing her
hair well, but cannot feel a more tender sentiment.
Miss Langley is like any other short girl, with a
broad nose and wide mouth, fashionable dress and
exposed bosom. Adm. Stanhope is a gentlemanlike
man, but then his legs are too short and his tail
too long.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Paragon: Thursday [May 21, 1801].
</div>

<p>The friendship between Mrs. Chamberlayne and
me which you predicted has already taken place,
for we shake hands whenever we meet. Our grand
walk to Weston was again fixed for yesterday, and
was accomplished in a very striking manner. Every
one of the party declined it under some pretence
or other except our two selves and we had therefore
a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>, but <i>that</i> we should equally have had,
after the first two yards, had half the inhabitants of
Bath set off with us.</p>

<p>It would have amused you to see our progress.
We went up by Sion Hill, and returned across
the fields. In climbing a hill Mrs. Chamberlayne is
very capital; I could with difficulty keep pace
with her, yet would not flinch for the world. On
plain ground I was quite her equal. And so we
posted away under a fine hot sun, <i>she</i> without any
parasol or any shade to her hat, stopping for nothing
and crossing the churchyard at Weston with as much
expedition as if we were afraid of being buried alive.
After seeing what she is equal to, I cannot help<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
feeling a regard for her. As to agreeableness, she
is much like other people.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I went with my mother to help look at some
houses in New King Street, towards which she felt
some kind of inclination, but their size has now
satisfied her. They were smaller than I expected
to find them; one in particular out of the two was
quite monstrously little; the best of the sitting-rooms
not so large as the little parlour at Steventon,
and the second room in every floor about capacious
enough to admit a very small single bed.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>You will be sorry to hear that Marianne Mapleton's
disorder has ended fatally. She was believed
out of danger on Sunday, but a sudden relapse carried
her off the next day. So affectionate a family must
suffer severely; and many a girl on early death has
been praised into an angel, I believe, on slighter pretensions
to beauty, sense, and merit, than Marianne.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Paragon: Tuesday [May 26, 1801].<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>

</b></div>

<p>The <i>Endymion</i> came into Portsmouth on Sunday
and I have sent Charles a short letter by this day's
post. My adventures since I wrote you three days
ago have been such as the time would easily contain.
I walked yesterday morning with Mrs. Chamberlayne
to Lyncombe and Widcombe, and in the evening
I drank tea with the Holders. Mrs. Chamberlayne's
pace was not quite so magnificent on this second trial
as on the first: it was nothing more than I could
keep up with, without effort, and for many many
yards together on a raised narrow footpath I led the
way. The walk was very beautiful, as my companion
agreed whenever I made the observation.
And so ends our friendship, for the Chamberlaynes
leave Bath in a day or two. Prepare likewise for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
loss of Lady Fust, as you will lose before you find
her. My evening visit was by no means disagreeable.
Mrs. Lillingston came to engage Mrs. Holder's conversation,
and Miss Holder and I adjourned after
tea to the inner drawing-room to look over prints
and talk pathetically. She is very unreserved and
very fond of talking of her deceased brother and
sister, whose memories she cherishes with an enthusiasm
which, though perhaps a little affected, is
not unpleasing. She has an idea of your being
remarkably lively, therefore get ready the proper
selection of adverbs and due scraps of Italian and
French. I must now pause to make some observation
on Mrs. Heathcote's having got a little boy.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
I wish her well to wear it out&mdash;and shall proceed.
Frank writes me word that he is to be in London
to-morrow: some money negotiation, from which
he hopes to derive advantage, hastens him from
Kent and will detain him a few days behind my
father in town. I have seen the Miss Mapletons
this morning. Marianne was buried yesterday, and
I called without expecting to be let in to enquire
after them all. On the servant's invitation, however,
I sent in my name, and Jane and Christiana,
who were walking in the garden, came to me immediately,
and I sat with them about ten minutes.
They looked pale and dejected but were more
composed than I had thought probable. When I
mentioned your coming here on Monday they said
they should be very glad to see you.</p>

<p>We drink tea to-night with Mrs. Lysons: now
this, says my Master, will be mighty dull.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>I assure you in spite of what I might choose to
insinuate in a former letter, that I have seen very
little of Mr. Evelyn since my coming here; I met
him this morning for only the fourth time, and as
to my anecdote about Sydney Gardens, I made the
most of the story because it came into advantage, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
in fact he only asked me whether I were to be in Sydney
Gardens in the evening or not. There is now something
like an engagement between us and the Phaeton, which
to confess my frailty I have a great desire to go out
in; but whether it will come to anything must
remain with him. I really believe he is very harmless;
people do not seem afraid of him here, and
he gets groundsel for his birds and all that.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">Yours affectionately,</span><br />

J. A.
</div>


<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;I am just returned from my airing
in the very bewitching Phaeton and four for which
I was prepared by a note from Mr. E., soon after
breakfast. We went to the top of Kingsdown,
and had a very pleasant drive. One pleasure
succeeds another rapidly. On my return I found
your letter, and a letter from Charles, on the table.
The contents of yours I suppose I need not repeat
to you; to thank you for it will be enough. I give
Charles great credit for remembering my uncle's
direction, and he seems rather surprised at it
himself. He has received &pound;30 for his share of the
privateer, and expects &pound;10 more, but of what avail
is it to take prizes if he lays out the produce in
presents to his sisters? He has been buying gold
chains and topaze crosses<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> for us&mdash;he must be well
scolded. The <i>Endymion</i> has already received orders for
taking troops to Egypt&mdash;which I should not like at all
if I did not trust to Charles being removed from her
somehow or other before she sails. He knows nothing
of his own destination he says&mdash;but desires me to
write directly&mdash;as the <i>Endymion</i> will probably sail in
three or four days. He will receive my yesterday's
letter to-day, and I shall write again by this post to
thank and reproach him. We shall be unbearably fine.</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>
<p>So began the five years' residence at Bath.</p>

<p>Cassandra and her father (the latter having been
paying visits in Kent and London) joined the others
at the beginning of June; and from that date till
September 1804 there is little that can be said
definitely about Jane's life.</p>

<p>We know, however, that it was the intention
of the Austens to spend the summer of 1801 by
the sea&mdash;perhaps at Sidmouth; and a letter of Eliza
Austen informs us that this plan was duly carried
out. She writes to Phila Walter on October 29:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I conclude that you know of our uncle and aunt
Austen and their daughters having spent the summer
in Devonshire. They are now returned to Bath,
where they are superintending the fitting up of their
new house.</p></div>

<p>So the house had at last been fixed on; and we
learn in the <i>Memoir</i> that it was No. 4 Sydney
Terrace,<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> in the parish of Bathwick. The houses
here face the Sydney Gardens, and it is a part of
Bath that Jane seems to have fancied. Her residence
there is now commemorated by a marble
tablet. How long the Austens resided in this house
cannot definitely be stated; perhaps they took it
for three years&mdash;at any rate, by the beginning of
1805 they had moved to 27 Green Park Buildings.
Possibly Mr. Austen, as he grew older, had found
the distance to the centre of the town too great for
his powers of walking.</p>

<p>One of the few facts we know concerning their
stay in Sydney Place is that at one time Mrs. Austen
was extremely ill, but the skill of her medical adviser,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
a certain Mr. Bowen,<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> and the affectionate care of
her daughters pulled her through and enabled her
to live for another twenty-five years. Mrs. Austen
has recorded the fact of her illness in some humorous
verses, entitled 'Dialogue between Death and Mrs. A.'</p>



<div class='center'>

</table></div>

<p>In 1802, in addition to the visit to Steventon
with its distressing incidents,<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Jane was at Dawlish;
for, in a letter written in 1814, she says of the library
at Dawlish that it 'was pitiful and wretched twelve
years ago and not likely to have anybody's publications.'
A writer, too, in <i>Temple Bar</i><a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> for February
1879, states that about this time the Austens went
to Teignmouth (which would be very easily combined
with a stay at Dawlish), and that they resided there
some weeks.</p>

<p>This was the year of the short cessation of hostilities
brought about by the Peace of Amiens. During
its continuance, we are told that the Henry Austens
went to France in the vain hope of recovering some
of her first husband's property, and narrowly escaped
being included amongst the <i>d&eacute;tenus</i>. 'Orders had
been given by Bonaparte's Government to detain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
all English travellers; but at the post-houses Mrs.
Henry Austen gave the necessary orders herself, and
her French was so perfect that she passed everywhere
for a native, and her husband escaped under this
protection.'<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>Our only evidence of Jane's having been absent
from Bath in 1803 is that Sir Egerton Brydges,<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> in
speaking of her, says: 'The last time I think that
I saw her was at Ramsgate in 1803.'</p>

<p>On Francis Austen's promotion (already mentioned),
Admiral Gambier seems rather to have gone
out of his way to choose him as his flag-captain
on the <i>Neptune;</i> but on the Peace of Amiens, he,
like many others, went on half-pay. His first employment
when war broke out again, in 1803, was
the raising from among the Kent fishermen of a corps
of 'sea fencibles,' to protect the coast from invasion.
His head-quarters were at Ramsgate, and it was quite
likely that Jane would visit him there, especially if
she could combine this visit with one to Godmersham.
We shall see later that the 'sea fencibles' did not
take up the whole of Frank's time.</p>

<p>She must now have begun to turn her mind again
to her neglected MSS., and especially to <i>Northanger
Abbey</i>. This, no doubt, underwent a thorough
revision (<i>Belinda</i>, mentioned in the famous dissertation
on novels, was not published till 1801);
and there is evidence<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> that she sold the MS., under
the title of <i>Susan</i>, in the spring of 1803: not, indeed,
to a Bath publisher&mdash;as has been often stated&mdash;but
to Messrs. Crosby &amp; Son of London, for ten pounds,
stipulating for an early publication. Distrustful of
appearing under her own name in the transaction,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Jane seems to have employed a certain Mr. Seymour&mdash;probably
her brother Henry's man of business&mdash;a
fact which suggests that the sale was effected
while Jane was staying in London with Henry.
For reasons best known to himself, Mr. Crosby did
not proceed with the publication.</p>

<p>Besides <i>Northanger Abbey</i>, Jane seems to have
written at this time the beginning of a tale which
was published in the second edition of the Memoir
as <i>The Watsons</i>,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> although the author had not given
that, or any other name, to it. The setting of the
story was very like that of the novels with which
we are so familiar, and the characters were sketched
in with a firm hand. One of these creations in particular
might have been expected to re-appear in
another book (if this work was to be laid aside);
but such a procedure was contrary to Jane Austen's
invariable practice. It is the character of a young
man&mdash;Tom Musgrave by name&mdash;a clever and good-natured
toady, with rather more attractive qualities
than usually fall to the lot of the members of that
fraternity. But why was it laid aside? The writer
of the <i>Memoir</i> suggests<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> that the author may have
become aware 'of the evil of having placed her
heroine too low, in a position of poverty and obscurity,
which, though not necessarily connected with
vulgarity, has a sad tendency to degenerate into it;
and therefore, like a singer who has begun on too
low a note, she discontinued the strain.'</p>

<p>To this we may add that circumstances soon
occurred to divert her mind from original composition
for a considerable period; and when at last she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
returned to it, she was much more likely to think of
the two completed stories that were lying in her desk
than of one that was only begun. She did, however,
retain in her recollection the outline of the intended
story. The MS. of <i>The Watsons</i>, still existing, is
written on the small sheets of paper described in the
<i>Memoir:</i> sheets which could be easily covered with
a piece of blotting-paper in case of the arrival of
unexpected visitors, and which would thus fit in
with her desire for secrecy. All the pages are written
in her beautifully neat handwriting; but some seem
to flow on without doubt or difficulty, while others
are subject to copious corrections. As all the MSS.
of her six published novels have perished, it is worth
our while to notice her methods where we can.</p>

<p>The first interruption that occurred to her writing
in 1804 was of a pleasant nature, and none of her
admirers need regret it: she went to Lyme with her
family. They had been joined in their summer
rambles by the Henry Austens, who afterwards
proceeded with Cassandra to Weymouth, leaving
Jane with her parents at Lyme. We have it on record
that Jane loved the sight of the beauties of nature
so much that she would sometimes say she thought
it must form one of the joys of heaven; but she had
few opportunities of visiting any scenes of especial
beauty. We need not therefore be surprised that
the impression produced by Lyme was so great that
she retained a vivid and accurate memory of the
details eleven years afterwards. In <i>Persuasion</i>, she
allowed herself to dwell on them with greater
fullness and greater enthusiasm than she had ever
displayed on similar occasions before. Readers of
that book who visit Lyme&mdash;especially if they have
the valuable help of the Miss Hills' descriptions and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
sketches&mdash;will feel no difficulty in recognising the
exact spot on the Cobb which was pointed out to
Tennyson as the scene of the fall of Louisa Musgrove,
or the well-placed but minute house at the corner
of the pier, past which Captain Benwick was
seen rushing for the doctor, and in which the
Harvilles managed to entertain a large party;
they may note the point on the steps leading down
to the sea where Mr. Elliot first saw Anne; and if
they go to the 'Royal Lion' Hotel and engage a
private sitting-room, they can look from the window,
as Mary Musgrove looked at her cousin's carriage,
when she recognised the Elliot countenance, but failed
to see the Elliot arms, because the great-coat was
folded over the panels.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>The letter which follows was written when
Cassandra was just leaving Weymouth to go to
Ibthorp where old Mrs. Lloyd lay very ill.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'>Lyme: Friday [September 14, 1804].<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cassandra</span>,&mdash;I take the first sheet of
fine striped paper to thank you for your letter from
Weymouth, and express my hopes of your being at
Ibthorp before this time. I expect to hear that you
reached it yesterday evening, being able to get as far
as Blandford on Wednesday. Your account of Weymouth
contains nothing which strikes me so forcibly
as there being no ice in the town. For every other
vexation I was in some measure prepared, and particularly
for your disappointment in not seeing the
Royal Family go on board on Tuesday, having
already heard from Mr. Crawford that he had seen
you in the very act of being too late. But for there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
being no ice, what could prepare me?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You
found my letter at Andover, I hope, yesterday, and
have now for many hours been satisfied that your kind
anxiety on my behalf was as much thrown away as
kind anxiety usually is. I continue quite well; in
proof of which I have bathed again this morning.
It was absolutely necessary that I should have the
little fever and indisposition which I had: it has been
all the fashion this week in Lyme.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We are
quite settled in our lodgings by this time, as you may
suppose, and everything goes on in the usual order.
The servants behave very well, and make no difficulties,
though nothing certainly can exceed the
inconvenience of the offices, except the general
dirtiness of the house and furniture, and all its inhabitants.
I endeavour, as far as I can, to supply
your place, and be useful, and keep things in order.
I detect dirt in the water decanters, as fast as I can,
and keep everything as it was under your administration.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
James is the delight of our lives, he
is quite an Uncle Toby's annuity to us. My Mother's
shoes were never so well blacked before, and our
plate never looked so clean. He waits extremely
well, is attentive, handy, quick and quiet, and in
short has a great many more than all the cardinal
virtues (for the cardinal virtues in themselves have
been so often possessed that they are no longer worth
having), and amongst the rest, that of wishing to go
to Bath, as I understand from Jenny. He has the
laudable thirst I fancy for travelling, which in poor
James Selby was so much reprobated; and part of
his disappointment in not going with his master
arose from his wish of seeing London.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The ball last night was pleasant, but not full for
Thursday. My father staid very contentedly till half-past
nine (we went a little after eight), and then walked
home with James and a lanthorn, though I believe
the lanthorn was not lit, as the moon was up; but
this lanthorn may sometimes be a great convenience<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
to him. My mother and I staid about an hour
later. Nobody asked me the two first dances; the
two next I danced with Mr. Crawford, and had
I chosen to stay longer might have danced with
Mr. Granville, Mrs. Granville's son, whom my dear
friend Miss A. offered to introduce to me, or with a
new odd-looking man who had been eyeing me for
some time, and at last, without any introduction,
asked me if I meant to dance again. I think he must
be Irish by his ease, and because I imagine him to
belong to the hon<sup>ble</sup> B.'s, who are the son, and son's
wife of an Irish viscount, bold queer-looking people,
just fit to be quality at Lyme.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I called yesterday morning (ought it not in strict
propriety to be termed yester-morning?) on Miss A.
and was introduced to her father and mother. Like
other young ladies she is considerably genteeler than
her parents. Mrs. A. sat darning a pair of stockings
the whole of my visit. But do not mention this at
home, lest a warning should act as an example. We
afterwards walked together for an hour on the Cobb;
she is very converseable in a common way; I do not
perceive wit or genius, but she has sense and some
degree of taste, and her manners are very engaging.
She seems to like people rather too easily. She
thought the D.'s pleasant, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>Friday Evening.</i>&mdash;The bathing was so delightful
this morning and Molly so pressing with me to
enjoy myself that I believe I staid in rather too
long, as since the middle of the day I have felt
unreasonably tired. I shall be more careful another
time, and shall not bathe to-morrow as I had before
intended. Jenny and James are walked to
Charmouth this afternoon. I am glad to have such
an amusement for him, as I am very anxious
for his being at once quiet and happy. He can
read, and I must get him some books. Unfortunately
he has read the first Vol. of <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
We have the Pinckards' newspaper however which
I shall take care to lend him.</p></div>

<p>As the autumn of 1804 was succeeded by winter,
Jane's thoughts were to be taken up by more serious
considerations. On her birthday, December 16,
occurred the death (by a fall from her horse) of her
great friend, Mrs. Lefroy, on which we have already
dwelt.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>But she was shortly to suffer an even greater
loss, for on January 21, 1805, her father died, after
an illness of only forty-eight hours. Jane's letter,
or rather two letters&mdash;for, the first being wrongly
directed, she had to write a second&mdash;to her brother
Frank on this occasion have fortunately been kept.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'><span style="margin-right: 8em;">Green Park Buildings:</span><br />
Tuesday evening, January 22, 1805.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a><br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dearest Frank</span>,&mdash;I wrote to you yesterday,
but your letter to Cassandra this morning, by which
we learn the probability of your being by this time
at Portsmouth, obliges me to write to you again,
having unfortunately a communication as necessary
as painful to make to you. Your affectionate heart
will be greatly wounded, and I wish the shock could
have been lessened by a better preparation; but the
event has been sudden and so must be the information
of it. We have lost an excellent father. An illness
of only eight and forty hours carried him off yesterday
morning between ten and eleven. He was seized on
Saturday with a return of the feverish complaint
which he had been subject to for the last three years.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
A physician was called in yesterday morning,
but he was at that time past all possibility of cure;
and Dr. Gibbs and Mr. Bowen had scarcely left his
room before he sunk into a sleep from which he
never woke.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>
<p>It has been very sudden. Within twenty-four
hours of his death he was walking about with only
the help of a stick&mdash;was even reading.</p>

<p>We had, however, some hours of preparation, and
when we understood his recovery to be hopeless,
most fervently did we pray for the speedy release
which ensued. To have seen him languishing long,
struggling for hours, would have been dreadful, and,
thank God, we were all spared from it.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Except the restlessness and confusion of high
fever, he did not suffer, and he was mercifully spared
from knowing that he was about to quit objects so
beloved, and so fondly cherished as his wife and
children ever were. His tenderness as a father, who
can do justice to?</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The funeral is to be on Saturday at Walcot Church.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
The serenity of the corpse is most delightful. It
preserves the sweet benevolent smile which always
distinguished him. They kindly press my mother to
remove to Steventon as soon as it is all over, but I
do not believe she will leave Bath at present. We
must have this house for three months longer, and
here we shall probably stay till the end of that time.
We all unite in love, and I am</p>

<p>The companion letter, sent to a different address,
gives a similar account, and contains also these
words<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>Heavy as is the blow, we can already feel that a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
thousand comforts remain to us to soften it. Next
to that of the consciousness of his worth and constant
preparation for another world, is the remembrance of
his having suffered, comparatively speaking, nothing.
Being quite insensible of his own state, he was spared
all pain of separation, and he went off almost in his
sleep. My mother bears the shock as well as possible;
she was quite prepared for it and feels all the blessing
of his being spared a long illness. My uncle and
aunt have been with us and show us every imaginable
kindness.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Adieu, my dearest Frank. The loss of such a
parent must be felt, or we should be brutes. I wish
I could give you a better preparation, but it has
been impossible.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">Yours ever affectionately,</span><br />

<p>Mr. Austen's death placed his widow and daughters
in straitened circumstances; for most of his income
had been derived from the livings of Steventon and
Deane. In fact the income of Mrs. Austen, together
with that of Cassandra (who had inherited one
thousand pounds from her intended husband, Thomas
Fowle), was no more than two hundred and ten
pounds. Fortunately, she had sons who were only
too glad to be able to help her, and her income was
raised to four hundred and sixty pounds a year by
contributions of one hundred pounds from Edward,
and fifty pounds from James, Henry, and Frank
respectively. Frank, indeed, was ready to do more;
for Henry wrote to him to say that their mother
'feels the magnificence of your offer and accepts of
half.' Mrs. Austen's first idea was to remain in
Bath so long as her brother, Mr. Leigh Perrot,
lived there. Accordingly, she gave up her house at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Lady Day, and moved, with her daughters and one
maid, into furnished lodgings at 25 Gay Street.</p>

<p>Early in April, Cassandra was staying at Ibthorp,
where it was her lot to attend another death-bed&mdash;that
of old Mrs. Lloyd.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'><br />25 Gay Street: Monday [April 8, 1805].
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cassandra</span>,&mdash;Here is a day for you!
Did Bath or Ibthorp ever see a finer 8th of April?
It is March and April together, the glare of one and
the warmth of the other. We do nothing but walk
about. As far as your means will admit, I hope you
profit by such weather too. I dare say you are
already the better for change of place. We were out
again last night. Miss Irvine invited us, when I met
her in the Crescent, to drink tea with them, but I
rather declined it, having no idea that my mother
would be disposed for another evening visit there so
soon; but when I gave her the message, I found her
very well inclined to go; and accordingly, on leaving
Chapel, we walked to Lansdown. This morning we
have been to see Miss Chamberlayne look hot on
horseback. Seven years and four months ago we
went to the same riding-house to see Miss Lefroy's
performance! What a different set are we now
moving in! But seven years, I suppose, are enough
to change every pore of one's skin and every feeling
of one's mind. We did not walk long in the Crescent
yesterday. It was hot and not crowded enough; so
we went into the field, and passed close by S. T. and
Miss S.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> again. I have not yet seen her face, but
neither her dress nor air have anything of the dash
or stylishness which the Browns talked of; quite the
contrary; indeed, her dress is not even smart, and her
appearance very quiet. Miss Irvine says she is never
speaking a word. Poor wretch; I am afraid she is
<i>en p&eacute;nitence</i>. Here has been that excellent Mrs.
Coulthart calling, while my mother was out, and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
was believed to be so. I always respected her, as a
good-hearted friendly woman. And the Brownes have
been here; I find their affidavits on the table. The
<i>Ambuscade</i> reached Gibraltar on the 9th of March,
and found all well; so say the papers. We have had
no letters from anybody, but we expect to hear from
Edward to-morrow, and from you soon afterwards.
How happy they are at Godmersham now! I shall be
very glad of a letter from Ibthorp, that I may know
how you all are, but particularly yourself. This is
nice weather for Mrs. J. Austen's going to Speen, and
I hope she will have a pleasant visit there. I expect
a prodigious account of the christening dinner;
perhaps it brought you at last into the company
of Miss Dundas again.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;I received your letter last night, and
wish it may be soon followed by another to say that
all is over; but I cannot help thinking that nature
will struggle again, and produce a revival. Poor
woman! May her end be peaceful and easy as the
exit we have witnessed! And I dare say it will. If
there is no revival, suffering must be all over; even
the consciousness of existence, I suppose, was gone
when you wrote. The nonsense I have been writing
in this and in my last letter seems out of place at such
a time, but I will not mind it; it will do you no harm,
and nobody else will be attacked by it. I am heartily
glad that you can speak so comfortably of your own
health and looks, though I can scarcely comprehend
the latter being really approved. Could travelling
fifty miles produce such an immediate change? You
were looking very poorly here, and everybody seemed
sensible of it. Is there a charm in a hack post-chaise?
But if there were, Mrs. Craven's carriage
might have undone it all. I am much obliged to you
for the time and trouble you have bestowed on
Mary's cap, and am glad it pleases her; but it will
prove a useless gift at present, I suppose. Will not
she leave Ibthorp on her mother's death? As a
companion you are all that Martha can be supposed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
to want, and in that light, under these circumstances,
your visit will indeed have been well timed.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The Cookes want us to drink tea with them to-night,
but I do not know whether my mother will
have nerves for it. We are engaged to-morrow
evening&mdash;what request we are in! Mrs. Chamberlayne
expressed to her niece her wish of being intimate
enough with us to ask us to drink tea with her in a
quiet way. We have therefore offered her ourselves
and our quietness through the same medium. Our tea
and sugar will last a great while. I think we are just
the kind of people and party to be treated about among
our relations; we cannot be supposed to be very rich.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;I was not able to go on yesterday;
all my wit and leisure were bestowed on letters to
Charles and Henry. To the former I wrote in consequence
of my mother's having seen in the papers
that the <i>Urania</i> was waiting at Portsmouth for the
convoy for Halifax. This is nice, as it is only three
weeks ago that you wrote by the <i>Camilla</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I wrote
to Henry because I had a letter from him in which
he desired to hear from me very soon. His to me
was most affectionate and kind, as well as entertaining;
there is no merit to him in <i>that;</i> he cannot help
being amusing.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He offers to meet us on the sea
coast, if the plan of which Edward gave him some
hint takes place. Will not this be making the execution
of such a plan more desirable and delightful
than ever? He talks of the rambles we took together
last summer with pleasing affection.</p>

<span style="margin-right: 8em;">Gay Street: Sunday Evening,</span><br />
April 21 [1805].<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a><br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cassandra</span>,&mdash;I am much obliged to
you for writing to me again so soon; your letter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
yesterday was quite an unexpected pleasure. Poor
Mrs. Stent! it has been her lot to be always in the
way; but we must be merciful, for perhaps in time
we may come to be Mrs. Stents ourselves, unequal
to anything, and unwelcome to everybody. Your
account of Martha is very comfortable indeed, and
now we shall be in no fear of receiving a worse. This
day, if she has gone to church, must have been a trial
to her feelings, but it will be the last of any acuteness.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yesterday
was a busy day with me. I went
to Sydney Gardens soon after one and did not return
until four, and after dinner I walked to Weston. My
morning engagement was with the Cookes, and our
party consisted of George and Mary, a Mr. and Miss
B. who had been with us at the concert, and the
youngest Miss W. Not Julia; we have done with
her; she is very ill; but Mary. Mary W.'s turn is
actually come to be grown up, and have a fine complexion,
and wear a great square muslin shawl. I
have not expressly enumerated myself among the
party, but there I was, and my cousin George was very
kind, and talked sense to me every now and then, in
the intervals of his more animated fooling with Miss
B., who is very young, and rather handsome, and
whose gracious manners, ready wit, and solid remarks,
put me somewhat in mind of my old acquaintance
L. L. There was a monstrous deal of stupid quizzing
and common-place nonsense talked, but scarcely any
wit; all that bordered on it or on sense came from
my cousin George, whom altogether I like very well.
Mr. B. seems nothing more than a tall young man.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. My
evening engagement and walk was with Miss A.,
who had called on me the day before, and gently
upbraided me in her turn with a change of manners
to her since she had been in Bath, or at least of late.
Unlucky me! that my notice should be of such consequence,
and my manners so bad! She was so well
disposed, and so reasonable, that I soon forgave her,
and made this engagement with her in proof of it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
She is really an agreeable girl, so I think I may like
her; and her great want of a companion at home,
which may well make any tolerable acquaintance
important to her, gives her another claim on my
attention. I shall as much as possible endeavour to
keep my intimacies in their proper place, and prevent
their clashing.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Among so many friends, it will
be well if I do not get into a scrape; and now
here is Miss Blachford come. I should have gone
distracted if the Bullers had staid.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>I am quite of your opinion as to the folly of
concealing any longer our intended partnership
with Martha, and wherever there has of late been
an enquiry on the subject I have always been
sincere, and I have sent word of it to the Mediterranean
in a letter to Frank. None of <i>our</i> nearest
connections I think will be unprepared for it, and I
do not know how to suppose that Martha's have not
foreseen it.</p>

<p>When I tell you we have been visiting a
Countess this morning, you will immediately, with
great justice, but no truth, guess it to be Lady Roden.
No: it is Lady Leven, the mother of Lord Balgonie.
On receiving a message from Lord and Lady Leven
through the Mackays, declaring their intention of
waiting on us, we thought it right to go to them.
I hope we have not done too much, but the friends
and admirers of Charles must be attended to. They
seem very reasonable, good sort of people, very civil,
and full of his praise.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> We were shewn at first
into an empty drawing-room, and presently in came
his lordship, not knowing who we were, to apologise
for the servant's mistake, and tell a lie himself
that Lady Leven was not within. He is a tall
gentlemanlike-looking man, with spectacles, and
rather deaf. After sitting with him ten minutes we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
walked away; but, Lady Leven coming out of the
dining parlour as we passed the door, we were obliged
to attend her back to it, and pay our visit over again.
She is a stout woman, with a very handsome face.
By this means we had the pleasure of hearing Charles's
praises twice over. They think themselves excessively
obliged to him, and estimate him so highly as
to wish Lord Balgonie, when he is quite recovered, to
go out to him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There is a pretty little Lady
Marianne of the party, to be shaken hands with,
and asked if she remembered Mr. Austen.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>I shall write to Charles by the next packet, unless
you tell me in the meantime of your intending to
do it.</p>

<p>'Cousin George' was the Rev. George Leigh
Cooke, long known and respected at Oxford, where
he held important offices, and had the privilege of
helping to form the minds of men more eminent
than himself. As tutor at Corpus Christi College,
he had under his charge Arnold, Keble, and Sir
J. T. Coleridge.</p>

<p>The 'intended partnership' with Martha was an
arrangement by which Martha Lloyd joined the
family party: an arrangement which was based on
their affectionate friendship for her, and which succeeded
so well that it lasted through Southampton
and Chawton, and did not end until after the death
of Mrs. Austen in 1827.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>FROM BATH TO SOUTHAMPTON</h3>

<h3>1805-1808</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>The</span> addition of Martha to the family party made
it easy for the two sisters to leave their mother in
August and pay a visit to Godmersham; and owing to
the fact that they, each in turn, varied their stay
at Godmersham by paying a short visit to Lady
Bridges at Goodnestone Farm, we have three brief
letters from Jane at this date. She was spending
her time in the usual way, seeing a good deal of
her sister-in-law's neighbours and connexions, and
playing with her nephews and nieces.</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'><br />Godmersham Park: Saturday [August 24, 1805].
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cassandra</span>,&mdash; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. George<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> is a fine
boy, and well behaved, but Daniel chiefly delighted
me; the good humour of his countenance is quite
bewitching. After tea we had a cribbage-table,
and he and I won two rubbers of his brother
and Mrs. Mary. Mr. Brett was the only person
there, besides our two families.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Yesterday was a very quiet day with us; my
noisiest efforts were writing to Frank, and playing
battledore and shuttlecock with William; he and I
have practised together two mornings, and improve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
a little; we have frequently kept it up <i>three</i> times,
and once or twice <i>six</i>.</p>

<p>The two Edwards went to Canterbury in the
chaise, and found Mrs. Knight as you found her,
I suppose, the day before, cheerful but weak.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I have been used very ill this morning: I have
received a letter from Frank which I ought to have
had when Elizabeth and Henry had theirs, and which
in its way from Albany<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> to Godmersham has been to
Dover and Steventon. It was finished on the 16th,
and tells what theirs told before as to his present
situation<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>; he is in a great hurry to be married, and
I have encouraged him in it, in the letter which ought
to have been an answer to his. He must think it very
strange that I do not acknowledge the receipt of his,
when I speak of those of the same date to Eliz. and
Henry; and to add to my injuries, I forgot to number
mine on the outside.</p>


<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Elizabeth has this moment proposed a scheme
which will be very much for my pleasure if equally
convenient to the other party; it is that when you
return on Monday, I should take your place at
Goodnestone for a few days. Harriot cannot be insincere,
let her try for it ever so much, and therefore
I defy her to accept this self-invitation of mine, unless
it be really what perfectly suits her. As there is no
time for an answer, I shall go in the carriage on
Monday, and can return with you, if my going to
Goodnestone is at all inconvenient.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Goodnestone Farm: Tuesday [August 27, 1805].
</div>

<p>There is no chance of tickets for the Mr. Bridgeses,
as no gentlemen but of the garrison are invited.</p>

<p>With a civil note to be fabricated to Lady F., and
an answer written to Miss H., you will easily believe
that we could not begin dinner till six. We were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
agreeably surprised by Edward Bridges's company
to it. He had been, strange to tell, too late for the
cricket match, too late at least to play himself, and,
not being asked to dine with the players,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> came home.
It is impossible to do justice to the hospitality of his
attentions towards me; he made a point of ordering
toasted cheese for supper entirely on my account.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Goodnestone Farm: Friday [August 30, 1805].
</div>

<p>Next week seems likely to be an unpleasant one
to this family on the matter of game. The evil
intentions of the Guards are certain, and the gentlemen
of the neighbourhood seem unwilling to come
forward in any decided or early support of their
rights. Edward Bridges has been trying to rouse
their spirits, but without success. Mr. Hammond,
under the influence of daughters and an expected
ball, declares he will do nothing.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">Yours affectionately,</span><br />

</div></div>

<p>Cassandra and Jane had a scheme for going to
Worthing with some of their young nephews and
nieces; but we can say no more about the plan, for
the letters now cease until January 1807. As for
the events of 1806, there is every reason to believe
that the Austens spent the first part of that year in
Bath, dividing their time somewhat uncomfortably
between different lodgings.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Francis Austen had been helping to
make history&mdash;though not always in so front a rank
as he would have desired to occupy. We left him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
raising the 'sea fencibles' at Ramsgate, instructing
the defenders of the coast, and considering the possibilities
of a landing by the French in their flat-bottomed
vessels. It was at Ramsgate that he was
noted as '<i>the</i> officer who knelt in Church,' and it was
there that he met and fell in love with his future
wife, Mary Gibson. She became in time one of the
best loved of the sisters-in-law; but we are told that
at the time the engagement was a slight shock to
Cassandra and Jane, because the lady chosen was <i>not</i>
Martha Lloyd, as they had hoped she might be.</p>

<p>Immediate marriage was out of the question, and
in May 1804 Frank was appointed to the <i>Leopard</i>,
the flagship of Admiral Louis, who at this time held
a command in the squadron blockading Napoleon's
flotilla. Frank's removal from the <i>Leopard</i> to the
<i>Canopus</i><a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> brought him home, for a short time, just
at the date of his father's death in January 1805.
In March, Admiral Louis hoisted his flag in the <i>Canopus</i>
and soon became second-in-command to Nelson.
Frank, as his flag-captain, took part in the chase after
Villeneuve to the West Indies and back. Thus far,
fortune had favoured him: a state of things which
seemed likely to continue, as he was personally known
to Nelson and had reason to hope that he would soon
give him the command of a frigate. But a sad
reverse was in store for him. September was spent
in blockading Cadiz; and, after Nelson's arrival from
England in the <i>Victory</i> on September 28, the <i>Canopus</i>
was ordered to 'complete supplies'<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> at Gibraltar.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
After this, followed an order to Admiral Louis to give
protection, as far as Cartagena, to a convoy proceeding
to Malta. Shaking themselves free from this
duty on the news that the enemy's fleet was coming
out of Cadiz, they made haste to join the main fleet
in spite of contrary winds, and with the dreadful
apprehension of being too late for the imminent battle.
'I do not profess,' he writes to Mary Gibson, 'to like
fighting for its own sake, but if there has been an
action with the combined fleets I shall ever consider
the day on which I sailed from the squadron as the
most inauspicious one of my life.' Six days later
(on October 27) he had to add: 'Alas! my dearest
Mary, all my fears are but too fully justified. The
fleets have met, and, after a very severe contest, a
most decisive victory has been gained by the English.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
To lose all share in the glory of a day which
surpasses all that ever went before is what I cannot
think of with any degree of patience.' But he soon
turns from selfish regrets to speak of the death of
Nelson, and adds: 'I never heard of his equal, nor do
I expect again to see such a man. To the soundest
judgment he united prompt decision and speedy
execution of his plans; and he possessed in a
superior degree the happy talent of making every
class of persons pleased with their situation, and
eager to exert themselves in forwarding the public
service.'</p>

<p>For his personal disappointment, Frank was,
to a certain extent, consoled by taking part in
Sir John Duckworth's cruise to the West Indies
and in the victory over the French at St. Domingo;
the squadron returning home, with three prizes,
to receive the thanks of Parliament on their
arrival at the beginning of May 1806. In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
following July, Francis Austen and Mary Gibson
were married.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the long residence at Bath of his
mother and sisters had come to an end. On July 2,
Mrs. Austen, her two daughters, and Martha Lloyd,
left Bath. Cassandra and Jane were thoroughly
tired of the place&mdash;so says Jane in a letter written
two years afterwards to Cassandra, reminding her
of their happy feelings of escape.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> The immediate
destination of the party was Clifton, and here Martha
Lloyd left them&mdash;perhaps for Harrogate in accordance
with the lines quoted above.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> The Austens did not
stay long at Clifton, and by the end of the month were
at Adlestrop Rectory on a visit to Mr. Thomas Leigh;
but neither did this prove more than a brief resting-place,
for on August 5 they set out, in somewhat
peculiar circumstances, together with Mr. Leigh, his
sister (Miss Elizabeth Leigh), Mr. Hill (agent of Mr.
Leigh),<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> and all the house party, to stay at Stoneleigh
Abbey in Warwickshire.</p>

<p>The circumstances were as follows. On July 2,
1806, occurred the death of the Hon. Mary Leigh,
who had been for twenty years life-tenant of the
Stoneleigh estates, under the will of her brother, the
last Lord Leigh. The estates now passed&mdash;according
to Lord Leigh's will&mdash;unto the first and nearest of
his kindred, being male and of his blood and name,
that should be alive at the time. All the Leighs of
the Stoneleigh branch had died out, and an heir had
to be sought among their remote cousins, the Adlestrop
Leighs. In ordinary circumstances the heir would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
have been James Henry Leigh, who was the head of
this branch; but by the peculiar wording of Lord
Leigh's will, all those of an older generation who
were thus 'the first and nearest of his blood and
name' appeared to take precedence of the natural
heir, although this does not seem to have been the
intention of Lord Leigh.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>The <i>eldest</i> Leigh was the Rev. Thomas Leigh,<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> who
therefore became the legal owner of Stoneleigh; but
as it was thought possible that there might be other
claimants, Mr. Leigh's solicitor advised his taking immediate
possession; and accordingly Mr. Leigh and all
his house party moved from Adlestrop to Stoneleigh.</p>

<p>This visit, and the whole question of the succession
to Stoneleigh, must have been especially interesting
to Jane's mother; for it seemed likely that Mrs.
Austen's own brother, Mr. Leigh Perrot, would, under
the terms of the will, have a life interest in the estate
after Mr. Thomas Leigh, if he survived him. It
was, however, obviously most in accordance with the
desire of the testator, and with the general opinion
of the family, that the estate should go according
to the usual rules of succession by primogeniture in
the Adlestrop branch; and as all the parties to the
transaction were on excellent terms with each other,
and as they believed it to be quite doubtful what
interpretation a court of law would put upon the
will, they settled the matter without any such intervention.
Mr. Leigh Perrot resigned his claim to the
estate and gained instead a capital sum of &pound;24,000<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
and an annuity of &pound;2000, which lasted until the death
of his wife in 1835. This is no doubt the agreement
with Adlestrop, mentioned below in the letter of
February 20, 1807,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> and it must, one would think,
have been considered satisfactory: indeed, the
writer speaks of the negotiation as 'happily over.'
The remaining clause in it which ensured to the Leigh
Perrots two bucks, two does, and the game off one
manor annually was less successful, for the bucks
sometimes arrived in such a condition as to demand
immediate burial. Yet it can hardly have been this
which made Jane at a later date speak of the 'vile compromise':
we should rather treat this expression as one
of her <i>obiter dicta</i>, not meant to be taken seriously.</p>

<p>'And here,' writes Mrs. Austen on August 13, 1806,
'we found ourselves on Tuesday (that is, yesterday
se'nnight), eating fish, venison, and all manner of
good things, in a large and noble parlour hung round
with family portraits.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Austen had expected to find Stoneleigh very
grand, but the magnificence of the place surpassed
her expectations. After describing its exterior, she
adds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>At nine in the morning we say our prayers in
a handsome chapel of which the pulpit, &amp;c., is now
hung in black. Then follows breakfast, consisting
of chocolate, coffee, and tea, plum cake, pound cake,
hot rolls, cold rolls, bread and butter, and dry toast
for me. The house steward, a fine large respectable-looking
man, orders all these matters. Mr. Leigh
and Mr. Hill are busy a great part of the morning.
<i>We</i> walk a good deal, for the woods are impenetrable
to the sun, even in the middle of an August day.
I do not fail to spend some part of every day in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
kitchen garden, where the quantity of small fruit
exceeds anything you can form an idea of.</p></div>

<p>She concludes her letter by saying:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Our visit has been a most pleasant one. We
all seem in good humour, disposed to be pleased, and
endeavouring to be agreeable, and I hope we succeed.
Poor Lady Saye and Sele, to be sure, is rather tormenting,
though sometimes amusing, and affords
Jane many a good laugh, but she fatigues me sadly
on the whole. To-morrow we depart. We have seen
the remains of Kenilworth, which afforded us much
entertainment, and I expect still more from the
sight of Warwick Castle, which we are going to see
to-day.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p></div>

<p>From Stoneleigh, we may imagine the Austens
to have gone on to pay a promised visit to Hamstall-Ridware&mdash;Edward
Cooper's living in Staffordshire;
but the curtain drops on them once more, and is not
raised again until Jane is writing from Southampton
on January 7, 1807. Owing to the gap in the letters, we
have no means of knowing why the Austens selected
Southampton as a home; nor are we told what Jane
herself thought of the place. At any rate, it was a
change from Bath, and she preferred it to Canterbury,
which, from its nearness to Godmersham, would have
been another very suitable place of residence. Southampton
was in her old county, and within fairly easy
reach of her old home; and probably one reason for
choosing the neighbourhood of a naval centre was,
that it enabled them to join forces with Frank Austen
and his newly married wife: but we should doubt
whether Jane ever felt really at home during her two
or three years' residence there, or took much to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
society of the place. No doubt the partnership with
the Frank Austens and with Martha made it possible
for the party to command better quarters, and to live
in greater comfort than would have been within
reach of the slender means of the Austens by themselves;
and when Jane's letters begin again it is
pretty clear that the party, though still in lodgings,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
were getting ready to take possession in March of
their house in Castle Square. They were living in a
very quiet way, not caring to add to their acquaintance
more than was necessary. Cassandra was at
this time on a visit to Godmersham, and Martha
Lloyd was also away. The Austens were near enough
to Steventon to be visited occasionally by James
Austen and his wife; and between their own acquaintance,
and Frank's friends in the service, they had
what they wanted in the way of society.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'><br />Southampton: Wednesday [January 7, 1807].
</div>

<p>Of your visit there [to Canterbury] I must now
speak 'incessantly'; it surprises, but pleases me more,
and I consider it as a very just and honourable distinction
of you, and not less to the credit of Mrs.
Knight. I have no doubt of your spending your time
with her most pleasantly in quiet and rational conversation,
and am so far from thinking her expectations
of you will be deceived, that my only fear is of
your being so agreeable, so much to her taste, as to
make her wish to keep you with her for ever. If that
should be the case, we must remove to Canterbury,
which I should not like so well as Southampton.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>Alphonsine</i><a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> did not do. We were disgusted in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
twenty pages, as, independent of a bad translation,
it has indelicacies which disgrace a pen hitherto so
pure; and we changed it for <i>The Female Quixote</i>
which now makes our evening amusement: to me a
very high one, as I find the work quite equal to what
I remembered it.</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class="blockquot"><p>Our acquaintance increase too fast. He [Frank]
was recognised lately by Admiral Bertie, and a few
days since arrived the Admiral and his daughter
Catherine to wait upon us. There was nothing to like
or dislike in either. To the Berties are to be added the
Lances, with whose cards we have been endowed, and
whose visit Frank and I returned yesterday. They live
about a mile and three-quarters from S[outhampton]
to the right of the new road to Portsmouth, and I
believe their house is one of those which are to be seen
almost anywhere among the woods on the other side
of the Itchen. It is a handsome building, stands
high, and in a very beautiful situation.</p>

<p>We found only Mrs. Lance at home, and whether
she boasts any offspring besides a grand pianoforte
did not appear. She was civil and chatty enough,
and offered to introduce us to some acquaintance in
Southampton, which we gratefully declined.</p>

<p>I suppose they must be acting by the orders of
Mr. Lance of Netherton in this civility, as there seems
no other reason for their coming near us.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Southampton: [February 8, 1807].
</div>

<p>Our garden is putting in order by a man who
bears a remarkably good character, has a very fine
complexion, and asks something less than the first.
The shrubs which border the gravel walk, he says,
are only sweetbriar and roses, and the latter of an
indifferent sort; we mean to get a few of the better
kind, therefore, and at my own particular desire he
procures us some syringas. I could not do without a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
syringa, for the sake of Cowper's line.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> We talk also of a
laburnum. The border under the terrace wall is clearing
away to receive currants and gooseberry bushes,
and a spot is found very proper for raspberries.</p>

<p>The alterations and improvements within doors,
too, advance very properly, and the offices will be
made very convenient indeed. Our dressing table is
constructing on the spot, out of a large kitchen
table belonging to the house, for doing which we have
the permission of Mr. Husket, Lord Lansdown's<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
painter&mdash;domestic painter, I should call him, for he
lives in the castle. Domestic chaplains have given
way to this more necessary office, and I suppose
whenever the walls want no touching up he is
employed about my lady's face.</p>

<p>The morning was so wet that I was afraid we
should not be able to see our little visitor, but Frank,
who alone could go to church, called for her after
service, and she is now talking away at my side and
examining the treasures of my writing-desk drawers&mdash;very
happy, I believe. Not at all shy, of course.
Her name is Catherine, and her sister's Caroline.
She is something like her brother, and as short for
her age, but not so well-looking.</p>

<p>What is become of all the shyness in the world?
Moral as well as natural diseases disappear in the
progress of time, and new ones take their place.
Shyness and the sweating sickness have given way
to confidence and paralytic complaints.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>Evening.</i>&mdash;Our little visitor has just left us, and
left us highly pleased with her; she is a nice, natural,
open-hearted, affectionate girl, with all the ready<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
civility which one sees in the best children in the
present day; so unlike anything that I was myself
at her age, that I am often all astonishment and
shame. Half her time was spent at spillikins, which
I consider as a very valuable part of our household
furniture, and as not the least important benefaction
from the family of Knight to that of Austen.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>There, I flatter myself I have constructed you
a smartish letter, considering my want of materials,
but, like my dear Dr. Johnson, I believe I have dealt
more in notions than facts<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Southampton: [Friday, February 20, 1807].
</div>

<p>We have at last heard something of Mr. Austen's<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
will. It is believed at Tunbridge that he has left
everything after the death of his widow to Mr. M.
Austen's third son John; and, as the said John
was the only one of the family who attended the
funeral, it seems likely to be true.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>My mother has heard this morning from Paragon.
My aunt talks much of the violent colds prevailing
in Bath, from which my uncle has suffered ever since
their return, and she has herself a cough much worse
than any she ever had before, subject as she has
always been to bad ones. She writes in good humour
and cheerful spirits, however. The negotiation between
them and Adlestrop so happily over, indeed,
what can have power to vex her materially?</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;I have received your letter, but I
suppose you do not expect me to be gratified by its
contents. I confess myself much disappointed by
this repeated delay of your return, for though I had
pretty well given up all idea of your being with
us before our removal, I felt sure that March would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
not pass quite away without bringing you. Before
April comes, of course something else will occur
to detain you. But as <i>you</i> are happy, all this is
selfishness, of which here is enough for one page.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Frank's going into Kent depends, of course,
upon his being unemployed; but as the First Lord,
after promising Lord Moira that Captain A. should
have the first good frigate that was vacant, has
since given away two or three fine ones, he has no
particular reason to expect an appointment now.
<i>He</i>, however, has scarcely spoken about the Kentish
journey. I have my information chiefly from her,
and she considers her own going thither as more
certain if he should be at sea than if not.</p>

<p>Frank has got a very bad cough, for an Austen;
but it does not disable him from making very nice
fringe for the drawing-room curtains.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I recommend Mrs. Grant's<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> letters, as a present
to her [Martha]; what they are about, and how many
volumes they form, I do not know, having never
heard of them but from Miss Irvine, who speaks of
them as a new and much-admired work, and as one
which has pleased her highly. I have inquired for
the book here, but find it quite unknown.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>We are reading Baretti's other book,<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> and find
him dreadfully abusive of poor Mr. Sharpe. I can
no longer take his part against you, as I did nine
years ago.</p></div>

<p>Our knowledge of the house which was the
Austens' home at Southampton for two years, and
of its surroundings, is derived from the personal
reminiscences of the author of the <i>Memoir</i>, who
was now old enough to visit his relatives, and who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
tells us that at this time he began to know, and
'what was the same thing, to love' his Aunt Jane.
'They lived,' he says,<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> 'in a commodious old-fashioned
house in a corner of Castle Square .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. with a
pleasant garden, bounded on one side by the old
city walls; the top of this wall was sufficiently wide
to afford a pleasant walk, with an extensive view
easily accessible to ladies by steps.' Castle Square
itself was occupied 'by a fantastic edifice, too large
for the space in which it stood, though too small
to accord well with its castellated style, erected by
the second Marquis of Lansdowne.' The whole of
this building disappeared after the death of its
eccentric owner in November 1809. His half-brother
and successor in the peerage&mdash;the well-known
statesman&mdash;became in after life an ardent admirer
of Jane Austen's novels, and told a friend<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> that
'one of the circumstances of his life which he looked
back upon with vexation was that Miss Austen should
once have been living some weeks in his neighbourhood
without his knowing it.' Had he known it,
however, he would have had no reason&mdash;in the Southampton
period&mdash;for imagining her to be an author.</p>

<p>On March 9, 1807, we may imagine the party
taking possession of their new house; but Frank can
have seen but little of it before he took command of
the <i>St. Albans</i> in April, and went to the Cape of Good
Hope on convoying duty. He was back by June 30.</p>

<p>On Cassandra's return, the two sisters must have
been together for a considerable period; but till June
1808 we know little that is definite about them,
except that in September 1807, together with their
mother, they paid a visit to Chawton House&mdash;Edward
Austen's Hampshire residence.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p><p>During these years, Charles Austen was long
engaged in the unpleasant and unprofitable duty
of enforcing the right of search on the Atlantic
seaboard of America. Hardly anything is said in
the extant letters of his marriage to Fanny Palmer,
daughter of the Attorney-General of Bermuda, which
took place in 1807.</p>

<p>The month of June 1808 found Jane staying with
her brother Henry in Brompton<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>; but we have no
details of her stay beyond the fact that she watched
some of her acquaintance going to Court on the King's
birthday. On June 14 she left London with her
brother James, his wife and two children, on a visit
to Godmersham.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'><br />Godmersham: Wednesday [June 15, 1808].
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cassandra</span>,&mdash;Where shall I begin?
Which of all my important nothings shall I tell you
first? At half after seven yesterday morning Henry
saw us into our own carriage, and we drove away
from the Bath Hotel; which, by-the-bye, had been
found most uncomfortable quarters&mdash;very dirty,
very noisy, and very ill-provided. James began his
journey by the coach at five. Our first eight miles
were hot; Deptford Hill brought to my mind our
hot journey into Kent fourteen years ago; but
after Blackheath we suffered nothing, and as the
day advanced it grew quite cool. At Dartford,
which we reached within the two hours and three-quarters,
we went to the Bull, the same inn at which
we breakfasted in that said journey, and on the
present occasion had about the same bad butter.</p>

<p>At half-past ten we were again off, and, travelling
on without any adventure reached Sittingbourne by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
three. Daniel was watching for us at the door of the
'George,' and I was acknowledged very kindly by Mr.
and Mrs. Marshall, to the latter of whom I devoted
my conversation, while Mary went out to buy some
gloves. A few minutes, of course, did for Sittingbourne;
and so off we drove, drove, drove, and by
six o'clock were at Godmersham.</p>

<p>Our two brothers<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> were walking before the
house as we approached, as natural as life. Fanny
and Lizzie met us in the Hall with a great deal of
pleasant joy; we went for a few minutes into the
breakfast parlour, and then proceeded to our rooms.
Mary has the Hall chamber. I am in the Yellow
room&mdash;very literally&mdash;for I am writing in it at this
moment. It seems odd to me to have such a great
place all to myself, and to be at Godmersham without
you is also odd.</p>

<p>You are wished for, I assure you: Fanny, who
came to me as soon as she had seen her Aunt James
to her room, and stayed while I dressed, was as
energetic as usual in her longings for you. She is
grown both in height and size since last year, but
not immoderately, looks very well, and seems as to
conduct and manner just what she was and what
one could wish her to continue.</p>

<p>Elizabeth, who was dressing when we arrived,
came to me for a minute attended by Marianne,
Charles, and Louisa, and, you will not doubt, gave
me a very affectionate welcome. That I had received
such from Edward also I need not mention; but I
do, you see, because it is a pleasure. I never saw him
look in better health, and Fanny says he is perfectly
well. I cannot praise Elizabeth's looks, but they
are probably affected by a cold. Her little namesake
has gained in beauty in the last three years,
though not all that Marianne has lost. Charles is
not quite so lovely as he was. Louisa is much as
I expected, and Cassandra I find handsomer than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
I expected, though at present disguised by such a
violent breaking-out that she does not come down
after dinner. She has charming eyes and a nice
open countenance, and seems likely to be very
lovable. Her size is magnificent.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I feel rather languid and solitary&mdash;perhaps
because I have a cold; but three years ago we
were more animated with you and Harriot and Miss
Sharpe. We shall improve, I dare say, as we go on.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Edward and Caroline<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> seem very happy
here; he has nice play-fellows in Lizzie and Charles.
They and their attendant have the boys' attic. Anna
will not be surprised that the cutting off her hair
is very much regretted by several of the party
in this house; I am tolerably reconciled to it by
considering that two or three years may restore it
again.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Godmersham: Monday [June 20, 1808].
</div>

<p>This morning brought me a letter from Mrs.
Knight, containing the usual fee, and all the usual
kindness. She asks me to spend a day or two with
her this week, to meet Mrs. C. Knatchbull, who, with
her husband, comes to the White Friars to-day, and
I believe I shall go. I have consulted Edward, and
think it will be arranged for Mrs. J. A.'s going with
me one morning, my staying the night, and Edward
driving me home the next evening. Her very
agreeable present will make my circumstances quite
easy. I shall reserve half for my pelisse.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;I sent my answer by them [the
Moores] to Mrs. Knight; my double acceptance of her
note and her invitation, which I wrote without effort,
for I am rich, and the rich are always respectable,
whatever be their style of writing.</p>

<p>Ought I to be very much pleased with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
<i>Marmion?</i><a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> As yet I am not. James reads it aloud
every evening&mdash;the short evening, beginning at
about ten, and broken by supper.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Godmersham: Sunday [June 26, 1808].
</div>

<p>I am very much obliged to you for writing to me
on Thursday, and very glad that I owe the pleasure
of hearing from you again so soon to such an agreeable
cause; but you will not be surprised, nor perhaps so
angry as I should be, to find that Frank's history had
reached me before in a letter from Henry. We are all
very happy to hear of his health and safety; he wants
nothing but a good prize to be a perfect character.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>They [the Knatchbulls] return into Somersetshire
by way of Sussex and Hants, and are to be at
Fareham, and, perhaps, may be in Southampton, on
which possibility I said all that I thought right,
and, if they are in the place M<sup>rs.</sup> K. has promised
to call in Castle Square; it will be about the end of
July.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You and I need not tell each other how
glad we shall be to receive attention from, or pay it
to anyone connected with Mrs. Knight. I cannot help
regretting that now, when I feel enough her equal to
relish her society, I see so little of the latter.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Godmersham: Thursday [June 30, 1808].
</div>

<p>You are very kind in mentioning old Mrs. Williams
so often. Poor creature! I cannot help hoping that
each letter may tell of her suffering being over. If
she wants sugar I should like to supply her with it.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I give you all joy of Frank's return, which happens
in the true sailor way, just after our being told not to
expect him for some weeks. The wind has been very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
much against him, but I suppose he must be in our
neighbourhood by this time. Fanny is in hourly
expectation of him here. Mary's visit in the island
is probably shortened by this event. Make our kind
love and congratulations to her.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>James and Edward are gone to Sandling to-day&mdash;a
nice scheme for James, as it will show him a new
and fine country. Edward certainly excels in doing
the honours to his visitors, and providing for their
amusement. They come back this evening.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It is pleasant to be among people who know one's
connections and care about them, and it amuses me to
hear John Bridges talk of 'Frank.' I have thought a
little of writing to the Downs, but I shall not, it is so
very certain that he would be somewhere else when
my letter got there.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>Friday, July 1.</i>&mdash;It will be two years to-morrow
since we left Bath for Clifton, with what happy
feelings of escape!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In another week I shall be at home, and there,
my having been at Godmersham will seem like a
dream, as my visit to Brompton seems already.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The orange wine will want our care soon. But in
the meantime, for elegance and ease and luxury, the
Hattons and the Milles' dine here to-day, and I shall
eat ice and drink French wine, and be above vulgar
economy. Luckily the pleasures of friendship, of
unreserved conversation, of similarity of taste and
opinions, will make good amends for orange wine.</p>

<p>Little Edward is quite well again.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">Yours affectionately, with love from all,</span><br />

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>FROM SOUTHAMPTON TO CHAWTON</h3>

<h3>1808-1809</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>We</span> do not doubt that the orange wine was duly made,
and the pleasure of unreserved conversation enjoyed
during the remainder of the summer. Before the end
of September, Cassandra had gone to Godmersham on
what was to prove a long and a sad visit. She arrived
just at the time of the birth of her sister-in-law's
sixth son and eleventh child, John. For a time all
went well with mother and child; but on October 8
Elizabeth Austen was suddenly seized with sickness,
and died before the serious nature of her attack had
been fully realised.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> This sad event occurred, as the
reader will see, between the second and third of the
following letters. Edward Austen's two eldest boys,
Edward and George, were now at Winchester School,
but were taken away for a time on their mother's
death. They went at first to the James Austens, at
Steventon, no one appearing to think a journey to so
distant a county as Kent feasible; and Jane, whose
immediate impulse seems to have been to do what
she could for her nephews, resigned them rather
unwillingly for the time. On October 22 they went
on to their grandmother and aunt at Southampton;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
and then their Aunt Jane was able to devote herself
entirely to them, as her own Jane Bennet once did
to her small cousins, and to show how her 'steady
sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her
for attending to them in every way: teaching them,
playing with them, and loving them'&mdash;words which
she probably intended as a description of what
Cassandra would have done in a similar position.</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'><br />Castle Square: Saturday [October 1, 1808].
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cassandra</span>,&mdash;Your letter this morning
was quite unexpected, and it is well that it brings
such good news to counterbalance the disappointment
to me of losing my first sentence, which I had
arranged full of proper hopes about your journey,
intending to commit them to paper to-day, and not
looking for certainty till to-morrow.</p>

<p>We are extremely glad to hear of the birth of the
child, and trust everything will proceed as well as it
begins. His mamma has our best wishes, and he our
second best for health and comfort&mdash;though I suppose,
unless he has our best too, we do nothing for <i>her</i>.
We are glad it was all over before your arrival, and I
am most happy to find who the godmother is to be.
My mother was some time guessing the names.</p>

<p>About an hour and a half after your toils on
Wednesday ended, ours began. At seven o'clock
Mrs. Harrison, her two daughters and two visitors,
with Mr. Debary and his eldest sister, walked in.</p>

<p>A second pool of commerce, and all the longer
by the addition of the two girls, who during the
first had one corner of the table and spillikins to
themselves, was the ruin of us; it completed the
prosperity of Mr. Debary, however, for he won them
both.</p>

<p>Mr. Harrison came in late, and sat by the fire,
for which I envied him, as we had our usual luck<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
of having a very cold evening. It rained when our
company came, but was dry again before they left us.</p>

<p>The Miss Ballards are said to be remarkably
well-informed; their manners are unaffected and
pleasing, but they do not talk quite freely enough
to be agreeable, nor can I discover any right they
had by taste or feeling to go their late tour.</p>

<p>We have got the second volume of <i>Espriella's
Letters</i>,<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> and I read it aloud by candlelight. The
man describes well, but is horribly anti-English.
He deserves to be the foreigner he assumes.</p>

<p>The Marquis<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> has put off being cured for another
year; after waiting some weeks in vain for the
return of the vessel he had agreed for, he is gone
into Cornwall to order a vessel built for himself by a
famous man in that country, in which he means to
go abroad a twelvemonth hence.</p>
<p>With love to all,</p>
<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">Yours affectionately,</span><br />

J. A.
</div></div>

<p>Fanny Austen (afterwards Lady Knatchbull),
Edward's eldest daughter, had nearly completed
her sixteenth year. She was admirably adapted
for the difficult position into which she was about
to be thrown: that of companion to her father,
mistress of a large household, and adviser to her
younger brothers and sisters. She was sensible,
even-tempered, affectionate, and conscientious. She
did indeed prove 'almost another sister' to Jane,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
who, as Cassandra said afterwards, was perhaps better
known to her than to any other human being, except
Cassandra herself. Though this niece did not profess
any special literary ability, her Aunt always
valued her sound judgment on each new book: and
in return she gave her, without fear of offending,
advice<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> on the most delicate subjects. The short
extracts from Fanny's diary, which her son, Lord
Brabourne, gives us, show how constantly 'Aunt
Jane' was the object of her thoughts.</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
<div class='right'><br />Castle Square: Friday [October 7, 1808].
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cassandra</span>,&mdash;Your letter on Tuesday
gave us great pleasure, and we congratulate you
all upon Elizabeth's hitherto happy recovery; to-morrow,
or Sunday, I hope to hear of its advancing
in the same style. We are also very glad to know
that you are so well yourself, and pray you to
continue so.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>We found ourselves tricked into a thorough party
at Mrs. M.'s, a quadrille and a commerce table, and
music in the other room. There were two pools at
commerce, but I would not play more than one, for
the stake was three shillings, and I cannot afford to
lose that twice in an evening. The Miss M.'s were
as civil and as silly as usual.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;Thank you for your letter, which
found me at the breakfast table with my two
companions.</p>

<p>I am greatly pleased with your account of Fanny;
I found her in the summer just what you describe,
almost another sister; and could not have supposed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
that a niece would ever have been so much to me.
She is quite after one's own heart; give her my best
love, and tell her that I always think of her with
pleasure.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Martha was an hour and a half in Winchester,
walking about with the three boys and at the pastry-cook's.
She thought Edward grown, and speaks
with the same admiration as before of his manners;
she saw in George a little likeness to his uncle Henry.</p>


<div class='right'><br />[October 13.]
</div>

<p>I have received your letter, and with most
melancholy anxiety was it expected, for the sad
news reached us last night, but without any particulars.
It came in a short letter to Martha from
her sister, begun at Steventon and finished in
Winchester.</p>

<p>We have felt&mdash;we do feel&mdash;for you all, as you
will not need to be told: for you, for Fanny, for
Henry, for Lady Bridges, and for dearest Edward,
whose loss and whose sufferings seem to make those
of every other person nothing. God be praised
that you can say what you do of him: that he has
a religious mind to bear him up, and a disposition
that will gradually lead him to comfort.</p>

<p>My dear, dear Fanny, I am so thankful that
she has you with her! You will be everything to
her; you will give her all the consolation that
human aid can give. May the Almighty sustain
you all, and keep you, my dearest Cassandra, well;
but for the present I dare say you are equal to
everything.</p>

<p>You will know that the poor boys are at Steventon.
Perhaps it is best for them, as they will have more
means of exercise and amusement there than they
could have with us, but I own myself disappointed
by the arrangement. I should have loved to have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
them with me at such a time. I shall write to
Edward by this post.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>With what true sympathy our feelings are shared
by Martha you need not be told; she is the friend
and sister under every circumstance.</p>

<p>We need not enter into a panegyric on the
departed, but it is sweet to think of her great worth,
of her solid principles, of her true devotion, her
excellence in every relation of life. It is also consolatory
to reflect on the shortness of the sufferings
which led her from this world to a better.</p>

<p>Farewell for the present, my dearest sister.
Tell Edward that we feel for him and pray for
him.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Saturday night [October 15, 1808].
</div>

<p>Your accounts make us as comfortable as we
can expect to be at such a time. Edward's loss is
terrible, and must be felt as such, and these are too
early days indeed to think of moderation in grief,
either in him or his afflicted daughter, but soon we
may hope that our dear Fanny's sense of duty to
that beloved father will rouse her to exertion. For
his sake, and as the most acceptable proof of love to
the spirit of her departed mother, she will try to be
tranquil and resigned. Does she feel you to be a
comfort to her, or is she too much overpowered for
anything but solitude?</p>

<p>Your account of Lizzy is very interesting. Poor
child! One must hope the impression <i>will</i> be
strong, and yet one's heart aches for a dejected
mind of eight years old.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>We are anxious to be assured that Edward will
not attend the funeral, but when it comes to the
point I think he must feel it impossible.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I am glad you can say what you do of Mrs.
Knight and of Goodnestone in general; it is a great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
relief to me to know that the shock did not make
any of them ill. But what a task was yours to
announce it! <i>Now</i> I hope you are not overpowered
with letter-writing, as Henry<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> and John can ease
you of many of your correspondents.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Upon your letter to Dr. Goddard's<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> being forwarded
to them, Mary wrote to ask whether my
mother wished to have her grandsons sent to her.
We decided on their remaining where they were,
which I hope my brother will approve of. I am
sure he will do us the justice of believing that in
such a decision we sacrificed inclination to what
we thought best.</p>

<p>I shall write by the coach to-morrow to Mrs.
J. A., and to Edward, about their mourning, though
this day's post will probably bring directions to
them on that subject from yourselves. I shall
certainly make use of the opportunity of addressing
our nephew on the most serious of all concerns,
as I naturally did in my letter to him before. The
poor boys are, perhaps, more comfortable at Steventon
than they could be here, but you will understand <i>my
feelings</i> with respect to it.</p>

<p>To-morrow will be a dreadful day for you all.
Mr. Whitfield's<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> will be a severe duty. Glad shall
I be to hear that it is over.</p>

<p>That you are for ever in our thoughts you will
not doubt. I see your mournful party in my mind's
eye under every varying circumstance of the day;
and in the evening especially figure to myself its
sad gloom: the efforts to talk, the frequent summons
to melancholy orders and cares, and poor Edward,
restless in misery, going from one room to another,
and perhaps not seldom upstairs, to see all that
remains of his Elizabeth.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p><p>There must be a letter missing between October 15
and October 24, containing Jane's first comment on
the offer of a cottage at Chawton, made by Edward
Austen to his mother. In the midst of his grief&mdash;perhaps,
in consequence of his loss&mdash;he wished to
bind his mother and sisters more closely to himself.
He gave them a choice between a house near Godmersham,
and one at Chawton; but the mother and
sisters were what Jane afterwards called 'Hampshire-born
Austens,' and clung to their county. The offer was
particularly opportune, for Mrs. Austen was already
hesitating between Kent and Hampshire as a place
of residence. The attractions of a home at Chawton
became greater the more they were considered; and
though it was held to be necessary to consult the
Frank Austens, whom they would be leaving, no
doubt was entertained as to their answer.</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
<div class='right'><br />Castle Square: Monday [October 24, 1808].
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cassandra</span>,&mdash;Edward and George came
to us soon after seven on Saturday, very well, but
very cold, having by choice travelled on the outside,
and with no great coat but what Mr. Wise, the coachman,
good-naturedly spared them of his, as they sat
by his side. They were so much chilled when they
arrived, that I was afraid they must have taken cold;
but it does not seem at all the case; I never saw
them looking better.</p>

<p><i>They behave extremely well</i> in every respect,
showing quite as much feeling as one wishes to
see, and on every occasion speaking of their father
with the liveliest affection. His letter was read
over by each of them yesterday, and with many
tears; George sobbed aloud, Edward's tears do not
flow so easily; but as far as I can judge they are
both very properly impressed by what has happened.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Miss Lloyd, who is a more impartial judge than
I can be, is exceedingly pleased with them.</p>

<p>George is almost a new acquaintance to me, and
I find him in a different way as <i>engaging as Edward</i>.</p>

<p>We do not want amusement: bilbocatch,<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> at
which George is indefatigable, spillikins, paper ships,
riddles, conundrums, and cards, with watching the
flow and ebb of the river, and now and then a
stroll out, keep us well employed; and we mean
to avail ourselves of our kind papa's consideration,
by not returning to Winchester till quite the
evening of Wednesday.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The <i>St. Albans</i>, I find, sailed on the very day
of my letters reaching Yarmouth, so that we must
not expect an answer<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> at present; we scarcely feel,
however, to be in suspense, or only enough to keep
our plans to ourselves. We have been obliged to
explain them to our young visitors, in consequence
of Fanny's letter, but we have not yet mentioned
them to Steventon. We are all quite familiarised
to the idea ourselves; my mother only wants Mrs.
Seward to go out at Midsummer.</p>

<p>What sort of a kitchen garden is there? Mrs.
J. A. expresses her fear of our settling in Kent,
and, till this proposal was made, we began to look
forward to it here; my mother was actually talking
of a house at Wye. It will be best, however, as it is.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I hope your sorrowing party were at church
yesterday, and have no longer <i>that</i> to dread.
Martha was kept at home by a <i>cold, but I went
with my two nephews, and I saw Edward was much
affected by the sermon, which, indeed, I could have supposed
purposely addressed</i> to the afflicted, if the text
had not naturally come in the course of Dr. Mant's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
observations on the Litany: 'All that are in
danger, necessity, or tribulation,' was the subject
of it. The weather did not allow us afterwards to
get farther than the quay, where George was very
happy as long as we could stay, flying about from
one side to the other, and skipping on board a collier
immediately.</p>

<p>In the evening we had the Psalms and Lessons,
and a sermon at home, to which they were very
attentive; but you will not expect to hear that
they did not return to conundrums the moment it
<i>was over</i>.</p>

<p>While I write now, George is most industriously
making and naming paper ships, at which he afterwards
shoots with horse-chestnuts, brought from
Steventon on purpose; and Edward equally intent
over the <i>Lake of Killarney</i>, twisting himself about
in one of our great chairs.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;The day began cheerfully, but it is not
likely to continue what it should, for them or for us.
<i>We had a little water party</i> yesterday; I and my
two nephews went from the Itchen Ferry up to
Northam, where we landed, looked into the 74,
and walked home, and it was so much enjoyed
that I had intended to take them to Netley to-day;
the tide is just right for our going immediately
after moonshine,<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> but I am afraid there will be rain;
if we cannot get so far, however, we may perhaps go
round from the ferry to the quay.</p>

<p>I had not proposed doing more than cross the
Itchen yesterday, but it proved so pleasant, and so
much to the satisfaction of all, that when we
reached the middle of the stream we agreed to
be rowed up the river; both the boys rowed great
part of the way, and their questions and remarks,
as well as their enjoyment, were very amusing;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
George's enquiries were endless, and his eagerness
in everything reminds me often <i>of his Uncle Henry</i>.</p>

<p>Our evening was equally agreeable in its way:
I introduced <i>speculation</i>,<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> and it was so much approved
that we hardly knew how to leave off.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Of Chawton I think I can have nothing more
to say, but that everything you say about it in the
letter now before me will, I am sure, as soon as I
am able to read it to her, make my mother consider
the plan with more and more pleasure.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Sunday [November 21, 1808].
</div>

<p>Your letter, my dear Cassandra, obliges me to
write immediately, that you may have the earliest
notice of Frank's intending, if possible, to go to
Godmersham exactly at the time now fixed for your
visit to Goodnestone.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Your news of Edward Bridges<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> was <i>quite</i> news,
for I have had no letter from Wrotham. I wish
him happy with all my heart, and hope his choice
may turn out according to his own expectations,
and beyond those of his family; and I dare say
it will. Marriage is a great improver, and in a
similar situation Harriet may be as amiable as
Eleanor. As to money, that will come, you may
be sure, because they cannot do without it. When
you see him again, pray give him our congratulations
and best wishes. This match will certainly
set John and Lucy going.</p>

<p>There are six bedchambers at Chawton; Henry
wrote to my mother the other day, and luckily
mentioned the number, which is just what we
wanted to be assured of. He speaks also of
garrets for store places, one of which she immediately
planned fitting up for Edward's man servant;
and now perhaps it must be for our own;
for she is already quite reconciled to our keeping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
one. The difficulty of doing without one had
been thought of before. His name shall be Robert,
if you please.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Yes, the Stoneleigh business is concluded, but
it was not till yesterday that my mother was regularly
informed of it, though the news had reached
us on Monday evening by way of Steventon.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Our brother<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> we may perhaps see in the course of
a few days, and we mean to take the opportunity of
his help to go one night to the play. Martha ought
to see the inside of the theatre once while she lives
in Southampton, and I think she will hardly wish to
take a second view.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>How could you have a wet day on Thursday?
With us it was a prince of days, the most delightful
we have had for weeks; soft, bright, with a
brisk wind from the south-west; everybody was
out and talking of spring, and Martha and I did
not know how to turn back. On Friday evening
we had some very blowing weather&mdash;from 6 to 9,
I think we never heard it worse, even here. And
one night we had so much rain that it forced its
way again into the store closet, and though the
evil was comparatively slight and the mischief
nothing, I had some employment the next day in
drying parcels, &amp;c. I have now moved still more
out of the way.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Adieu! remember me affectionately to everybody,
and believe me,</p>

<p>The home at Chawton was now looked upon as
a certainty; though none of its future inhabitants
inspected it until February 1809, when Cassandra
visited it on her way back from Godmersham.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>
<p>It was some years since they had lived in the
country, and their future home was likely to be very
quiet; so, as Jane recovered her spirits, she determined
to crowd into her remaining months at Southampton
as much society and amusement as possible.
She went to two of the Southampton assemblies&mdash;her
last recorded appearances as an active ball-goer.</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
<div class='right'><br />Castle Square: Friday [December 9, 1808].
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cassandra</span>,&mdash;Soon after I had closed
my last letter to you we were visited by Mrs. Dickens
and her sister-in-law, Mrs. Bertie, the wife of a lately-made
Admiral. Mrs. F. A., I believe, was their first
object, but they put up with us very kindly, and Mrs.
D. finding in Miss Lloyd a friend of Mrs. Dundas, had
another motive for the acquaintance. She seems
a really agreeable woman&mdash;that is, her manners
are gentle, and she knows a great many of our
connections in West Kent. Mrs. Bertie lives in the
Polygon, and was out when we returned her visit,
which are <i>her</i> two virtues.</p>

<p>A larger circle of acquaintance, and an increase
of amusement, is quite in character with our approaching
removal. Yes, I mean to go to as many
balls as possible, that I may have a good bargain.
Everybody is very much concerned at our going
away, and everybody is acquainted with Chawton,
and speaks of it as a remarkably pretty village,
and everybody knows the house we describe, but
nobody fixes on the right.</p>

<p>I am very much obliged to Mrs. Knight for
such a proof of the interest she takes in me, and
she may depend upon it that I <i>will</i> marry Mr.
Papillon,<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> whatever may be his reluctance or my
own. I owe her much more than such a trifling
sacrifice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>
<p>Our ball was rather more amusing than I expected.
Martha liked it very much, and I did not gape till
the last quarter of an hour. It was past nine before
we were sent for, and not twelve when we returned.
The room was tolerably full, and there were, perhaps,
thirty couple of dancers. The melancholy part was,
to see so many dozen young women standing by
without partners, and each of them with two ugly
naked shoulders.</p>

<p>It was the same room in which we danced fifteen
years ago. I thought it all over, and in spite of the
shame of being so much older, felt with thankfulness
that I was quite as happy now as then. We paid an
additional shilling for our tea, which we took as we
chose in an adjoining and very comfortable room.</p>

<p>There were only four dances, and it went to my
heart that the Miss Lances (one of them, too, named
Emma) should have partners only for two. You
will not expect to hear that <i>I</i> was asked to dance, but
I was&mdash;by the gentleman whom we met <i>that Sunday</i>
with Captain D'Auvergne. We have always kept
up a bowing acquaintance since, and, being pleased
with his black eyes, I spoke to him at the ball, which
brought on me this civility; but I do not know his
name, and he seems so little at home in the English
language, that I believe his black eyes may be the
best of him. Captain D'Auvergne has got a ship.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Having now cleared away my smaller articles of
news, I come to a communication of some weight:
no less than that my uncle and aunt<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> are going to
allow James &pound;100 a year. We hear of it through
Steventon. Mary sent us the other day an extract
from my aunt's letter on the subject, in which the
donation is made with the greatest kindness, and
intended as a compensation for his loss in the
conscientious refusal of Hampstead living; &pound;100
a year being all that he had at the time called its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
worth, as I find it was always intended at Steventon
to divide the real income with Kintbury.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I am glad you are to have Henry with you again;
with him and the boys you cannot but have a cheerful,
and at times even a merry, Christmas.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>We want to be settled at Chawton in time for
Henry to come to us for some shooting in October,
at least, or a little earlier, and Edward may visit us
after taking his boys back to Winchester. Suppose
we name the 4th of September. Will not that do?</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Distribute the affectionate love of a heart not so
tired as the right hand belonging to it.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Tuesday [December 27, 1808].
</div>

<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Lady Sondes' match<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> surprises, but does not
offend me; had her first marriage been of affection,
or had there been a grown-up single daughter, I
should not have forgiven her; but I consider everybody
as having a right to marry <i>once</i> in their lives
for love, if they can, and provided she will now
leave off having bad headaches and being pathetic,
I can allow her, I can <i>wish</i> her, to be happy.</p>

<p>Do not imagine that your picture of your <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>
with Sir B.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> makes any change in our expectations
here; he could not be really reading, though he held
the newspaper in his hand; he was making up his
mind to the deed, and the manner of it. I think
you will have a letter from him soon.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>We have now pretty well ascertained James's
income to be eleven hundred pounds, curate paid,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
which makes us very happy&mdash;the ascertainment as
well as the income.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;I must write to Charles next week.
You may guess in what extravagant terms of praise
Earle Harwood speaks of him. He is looked up to by
everybody in all America.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Yes, yes, we <i>will</i> have a pianoforte, as good a
one as can be got for thirty guineas, and I will
practise country dances, that we may have some
amusement for our nephews and nieces, when we
have the pleasure of their company.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Tuesday [January 10, 1809].
</div>

<p>I am not surprised, my dear Cassandra, that you
did not find my last letter very full of matter, and I
wish this may not have the same deficiency; but we
are doing nothing ourselves to write about, and I am
therefore quite dependent upon the communications
of our friends, or my own wits.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The <i>St. Albans</i> perhaps may soon be off to help
bring home what may remain by this time of our poor
army,<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> whose state seems dreadfully critical. The
Regency seems to have been heard of only here;
my most political correspondents make no mention
of it. Unlucky that I should have wasted so much
reflection on the subject.</p>

<p>I can now answer your question to my mother
more at large, and likewise more at small&mdash;with
equal perspicuity and minuteness; for the very day
of our leaving Southampton is fixed; and if the
knowledge is of no <i>use</i> to Edward, I am sure it will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
give him pleasure. Easter Monday, April 3, is the
day; we are to sleep that night at Alton, and be
with our friends at Bookham the next, if they are
then at home; there we remain till the following
Monday, and on Tuesday, April 11, hope to be at
Godmersham.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>William will be quite recovered, I trust, by the
time you receive this. What a comfort his cross-stitch
must have been! Pray tell him that I should
like to see his work very much. I hope our answers
this morning have given satisfaction; we had great
pleasure in Uncle Deedes' packet; and pray let
Marianne know, in private, that I think she is quite
right to work a rug for Uncle John's coffee urn, and
that I am sure it must give great pleasure to herself
now, and to him when he receives it.</p>

<p>The preference of Brag over Speculation does not
greatly surprise me, I believe, because I feel the same
myself; but it mortifies me deeply, because Speculation
was under my patronage; and, after all, what is
there so delightful in a pair royal of Braggers? It is
but three nines or three knaves, or a mixture of them.
When one comes to reason upon it, it cannot stand its
ground against Speculation&mdash;of which I hope Edward
is now convinced. Give my love to him if he is.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>We are now in <i>Margiana</i>,<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> and like it very well
indeed. We are just going to set off for Northumberland
to be shut up in Widdrington Tower,
where there must be two or three sets of victims
already immured under a very fine villain.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Charles's rug will be finished to-day,
and sent to-morrow to Frank, to be consigned
by him to Mr. Turner's care; and I am going to send
<i>Marmion</i> out with it&mdash;very generous in me, I think.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>
<p>Have you nothing to say of your little namesake?
We join in love and many happy returns.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">Yours affectionately,</span><br />

<span class="smcap">J. Austen.</span>
</div></div>

<p>The Manydown ball was a smaller thing than I
expected, but it seems to have made Anna very
happy. At <i>her</i> age it would not have done for <i>me</i>.</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
<div class='right'><br />Tuesday [January 17, 1809].
</div>

<p>I hope you have had no more illness among you,
and that William will be soon as well as ever. His
working a footstool for Chawton is a most agreeable
surprise to me, and I am sure his grandmamma will
value it very much as a proof of his affection and
industry, but we shall never have the heart to put our
feet upon it. I believe I must work a muslin cover in
satin stitch to keep it from the dirt. I long to know
what his colours are. I guess greens and purples.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>To set against your new novel, of which nobody
ever heard before, and perhaps never may again,
we have got <i>Ida of Athens</i>,<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> by Miss Owenson, which
must be very clever, because it was written, as the
authoress says, in three months. We have only
read the preface yet, but her <i>Irish Girl</i><a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> does not
make me expect much. If the warmth of her
language could affect the body it might be worth
reading in this weather.</p>

<p>Adieu! I must leave off to stir the fire and call
on Miss Murden.</p>

<p><i>Evening.</i>&mdash;I have done them both, the first very
often. We found our friend as comfortable as she
can ever allow herself to be in cold weather. There
is a very neat parlour behind the shop for her to sit
in, not very light indeed, being <i>&agrave; la</i> Southampton,
the middle of three deep, but very lively from the
frequent sound of the pestle and mortar.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>
<div class='right'><br />Tuesday [January 24, 1809].
</div>

<p>I had the happiness yesterday of a letter from
Charles, but I shall say as little about it as possible,
because I know <i>that</i> excruciating Henry will have had
a letter likewise, to make all my intelligence valueless.
It was written at Bermuda on the 7th and 10th of
December. All well, and Fanny<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> still only in expectation
of being otherwise. He had taken a small
prize in his late cruise&mdash;a French schooner, laden
with sugar; but bad weather parted them, and
she had not yet been heard of. His cruise ended
December 1st. My September letter was the latest
he had received.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>You rejoice me by what you say of Fanny.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> I
hope she will not turn good-for-nothing this ever
so long. We thought of and talked of her yesterday
with sincere affection, and wished her a long enjoyment
of all the happiness to which she seems born.
While she gives happiness to those about her she is
pretty sure of her own share.</p>

<p>I am gratified by her having pleasure in what I
write, but I wish the knowledge of my being exposed
to her discerning criticism may not hurt my style,
by inducing too great a solicitude. I begin already
to weigh my words and sentences more than I did,
and am looking about for a sentiment, an illustration,
or a metaphor in every corner of the room. Could my
ideas flow as fast as the rain in the store closet it
would be charming.</p>

<p>We have been in two or three dreadful states
within the last week, from the melting of the snow,
&amp;c., and the contest between us and the closet has
now ended in our defeat. I have been obliged to
move almost everything out of it, and leave it to
splash itself as it likes.</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>You have by no means raised my curiosity after
Caleb.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> My disinclination for it before was affected,
but now it is real. I do not like the evangelicals.
Of course I shall be delighted when I read it, like
other people, but till I do I dislike it.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Your silence on the subject of our ball makes me
suppose your curiosity too great for words. We were
very well entertained, and could have stayed longer
but for the arrival of my list shoes to convey me home,
and I did not like to keep them waiting in the cold.
The room was tolerably full, and the ball opened by
Miss Glyn. The Miss Lances had partners, Captain
D'Auvergne's friend appeared in regimentals, Caroline
Maitland had an officer to flirt with, and Mr. John
Harrison was deputed by Captain Smith, being
himself absent, to ask me to dance. Everything
went well, you see, especially after we had tucked
Mrs. Lance's neckerchief in behind and fastened it
with a pin.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Adieu, sweet You. This is grievous news from
Spain. It is well that Dr. Moore was spared the
knowledge of such a son's death.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Monday [January 30].
</div>

<p>I am not at all ashamed about the name of the
novel, having been guilty of no insult towards your
handwriting; the diphthong I always saw, but
knowing how fond you were of adding a vowel wherever
you could, I attributed it to that alone, and the
knowledge of the truth does the book no service;
the only merit it could have was in the name of
Caleb, which has an honest, unpretending sound,
but in C&oelig;lebs there is pedantry and affectation.
Is it written only to classical scholars?</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>I am sorry to find that Sir J. Moore has a mother
living, but though a very heroic son he might not
be a very necessary one to her happiness. Deacon
Morrell may be more to Mrs. Morrell.</p>

<p>I wish Sir John had united something of the
Christian with the hero in his death. Thank heaven!
we have had no one to care for particularly among
the troops&mdash;no one, in fact, nearer to us than Sir
John himself.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The store closet, I hope, will never do so again,
for much of the evil is proved to have proceeded
from the gutter being choked up, and we have had
it cleared. We had reason to rejoice in the child's
absence at the time of the thaw, for the nursery was
not habitable. We hear of similar disasters from
almost everybody.</p>

<p>This letter brings the Southampton series to an
end. The party were not to take up their residence
at Chawton till the beginning of September; but
they left Southampton in April, and we may presume
that they carried out the programme mentioned in
Jane's letter of January 10, and went by way of
Alton to Bookham, and on to Godmersham.</p>

<p>In the whole series of letters written from Southampton,
there is not a single allusion to Jane's
being engaged upon any novel; and it has been inferred&mdash;probably
correctly&mdash;that her pen was idle
during these years. The fact that she had already
written three novels, but had not succeeded in
publishing a single one, can hardly have encouraged
her to write more. But it seems almost certain that,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
a few days before she left Southampton, she made
an effort to secure the publication of the novel which
we know as <i>Northanger Abbey</i>, by the publisher to
whom she had sold it as far back as 1803.</p>

<p>The circumstances are somewhat involved, but
appear to be as follows: Among the letters preserved
by Cassandra, is one said not to be in
Jane's hand, addressed to Messrs. Crosbie [<i>sic</i>] &amp; Co.,<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
of which these are the contents:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;In the spring of the year 1803 a
MS. novel in two vols., entitled <i>Susan</i>, was sold
to you by a gentleman of the name of Seymour,
and the purchase money &pound;10 rec<sup>d.</sup> at the same time.
Six years have since passed, and this work, of which
I am myself the Authoress, has never to the best of
my knowledge appeared in print, tho' an early publication
was stipulated for at the time of sale. I can only
account for such an extraordinary circumstance by
supposing the MS. by some carelessness to have been
lost, and if that was the case am willing to supply
you with another copy, if you are disposed to avail
yourselves of it, and will engage for no farther delay
when it comes into your hands. It will not be in my
power from particular circumstances to command
this copy before the month of August, but then if
you accept my proposal you may depend on receiving
it. Be so good as to send me a line in answer as soon
as possible as my stay in this place will not exceed a
few days. Should no notice be taken of this address,
I shall feel myself at liberty to secure the publication
of my work by applying elsewhere.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 3em;">I am, Gentlemen, etc., etc.,</span><br />

<small>Direct to Mrs. Ashton Dennis,</small><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><small>Post Office, Southampton</small></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><small>April 5, 1809.</small></span><br />
</div></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>
<p>With this letter was preserved the following
reply:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Madam</span>,&mdash;We have to acknowledge the receipt
of your letter of the 5th inst. It is true that at the
time mentioned we purchased of Mr. Seymour a
MS. novel entitled <i>Susan</i>, and paid him for it
the sum of &pound;10, for which we have his stamped
receipt, as a full consideration, but there was not any
time stipulated for its publication, neither are we
bound to publish it. Should you or anyone else
[publish it] we shall take proceedings to stop the sale.
The MS. shall be yours for the same as we paid
for it.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 6em;">For <span class="smcap">Crosby &amp; Co.</span></span><br />

<span style="margin-right: 4em;">I am yours, etc.</span><br />

<span class="smcap">Richard Crosby</span>.
</div></div>


<p>From the fact that this letter was carefully preserved
among Jane's correspondence, from the almost
exact coincidence of the dates at which the writer was
to leave Southampton, &amp;c., and from the fact that a
Mr. Seymour was Henry Austen's man of business,
there can be no reasonable doubt that the letter
refers to one of Jane Austen's works. It need cause
no surprise that she should have written under an
assumed name, or that she should have got some one
else to write for her in view of the secrecy which she
long maintained regarding the authorship of her
novels. If we assume, then, that the letter concerns
one of Jane Austen's novels&mdash;which novel is it?
At first sight it might naturally seem to be the
story called <i>Lady Susan</i>, which was published in
the second edition of the <i>Memoir;</i> but there
are two objections to this: one, that so far from
making two volumes, <i>Lady Susan</i> could hardly
have made more than one very thin volume;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
secondly, that <i>Lady Susan</i> is generally looked
upon as an early and immature production; and
Jane's judgment should have been too good to allow
her to desire the publication of an inferior work at
a time when she had already completed, in one form
or another, three such novels as <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>,
<i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, and <i>Northanger Abbey</i>. If,
therefore, it was not <i>Lady Susan</i>&mdash;What was it?
We cannot doubt that it was the novel we now know
as <i>Northanger Abbey</i>. When that book was prepared
for the press in 1816, it contained the following
'advertisement' or prefatory note:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This little work was finished in the year 1803,
and intended for immediate publication. It was
disposed of to a bookseller,<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> it was even advertised,
and why the business proceeded no further, the
author has never been able to learn.</p></div>

<p>So far, this accords closely enough with the
history of the MS. <i>Susan</i> as related in the letter
to Messrs. Crosby. For other details we must go
to the <i>Memoir</i>,<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> where we read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It [<i>Northanger Abbey</i>] was sold in 1803 to a
publisher in Bath for ten pounds; but it found so
little favour in his eyes that he chose to abide by
his first loss rather than risk further expense by
publishing such a work.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But when four novels
of steadily increasing success had given the writer
some confidence in herself, she wished to recover
the copyright of this early work. One of her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
brothers undertook the negotiation. He found the
purchaser very willing to receive back his money
and to resign all claim to the copyright.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p></div>

<p>This, too, accords closely enough with the history
of the MS. <i>Susan</i>, with the exception of one expression&mdash;namely,
'publisher in Bath'; but probably
the writer of the <i>Memoir</i> here made a slip, acting
on the very natural inference that a book in the
main written about Bath, by a writer at that time
living in Bath, would naturally have been offered
to a publisher in that town.</p>

<p>We are, indeed, confronted by two alternatives:
either that Jane Austen, in the year 1803, sold two
MSS. for the sum of ten pounds each&mdash;one named
<i>Susan</i>, to a London publisher, which has disappeared
altogether, unless it is the same as the
sketch <i>Lady Susan</i> (which, as we have seen, is
improbable), and the other (<i>Northanger Abbey</i>) to a
Bath publisher; or that the publisher was really
a London and not a Bath publisher, and that the
original Christian name of Catherine Morland was
Susan.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3><i>SENSE AND SENSIBILITY</i></h3>

<h3>1809-1811</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>We</span> are now bringing Jane Austen to the home which
she was to occupy through all the remaining eight
years of her life&mdash;the home from which she went to
lie on her deathbed at Winchester. Into this period
were to be crowded a large proportion of her most
important literary work, and all the contemporary
recognition which she was destined to enjoy. The
first six of these years must have been singularly
happy. So far as we know, she was in good health,
she was a member of a cheerful family party, and
she was under the protection of brothers who would
see that she and her mother and sister suffered no
discomfort. The eldest, James, Rector of Steventon,
could reach his mother's house in a morning's ride
through pleasant country lanes; Edward, the Squire,
occasionally occupied the 'Great House' at Chawton,
and often lent it to one of his naval brothers; while
Henry in London was only too happy to receive his
sisters, show them the sights of the metropolis, and
transact Jane's literary business. At home were her
mother, her life-long friend Martha, and above all her
'other self'&mdash;Cassandra&mdash;from whom she had no
secrets, and with whom disagreement was impossible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
But besides all these living objects of interest, Jane
also had her own separate and peculiar world, peopled
by the creations of her own bright imagination, which
by degrees became more and more real to her as she
found others accepting and admiring them. She
must have resumed the habit of writing with diffidence,
after her previous experience; but the sense of
progress, and the success which attended her venture
in publishing <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> would by degrees
make ample amends for past disappointments. She
was no doubt aided by the quiet of her home and
its friendly surroundings. In this tranquil spot,
where the past and present even now join peaceful
hands, she found happy leisure, repose of mind, and
absence of distraction, such as any sustained creative
effort demands.</div>

<p>Chawton was a charming village, about a mile
from Alton, and deep in the country; although two
main roads from Gosport and Winchester respectively
joined on their way towards London just in front of
the Austens' cottage. Indeed, the place still refuses to
be modernised, in spite of three converging railways,
and a necessary but civil notice in the corner requesting
motorists to 'drive slowly through the village.'
The venerable manor-house (then always called the
'Great House') is on the slope of a hill above the
Church, surrounded by garden, meadows, and trees,
and commanding a view over the intervening valley to
a hill opposite, crowned with a beech wood and known
as 'Chawton Park.' The cottage is in the centre of
the village, and, as it actually abuts on the road,
the Austens could easily see or be seen by travellers.
It is supposed to have been built as a posting inn,
but it had lately been occupied by Edward Austen's
steward. The author of the <i>Memoir</i> describes his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
uncle's improvements to the place in the following
words<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A good-sized entrance and two sitting-rooms
made the length of the house, all intended originally
to look upon the road; but the large drawing-room
window was blocked up and turned into a book-case,
and another opened at the side which gave to view
only turf and trees, as a high wooden fence and hornbeam
hedge shut out the Winchester road, which
skirted the whole length of the little domain.</p></div>

<p>He goes on to speak of the garden laid out at the
same time, which proved a great interest to the party
of ladies, and in which old Mrs. Austen worked
vigorously, almost to the end of her days, often attired
in a green round smock like a labourer's: a costume
which must have been nearly as remarkable as the
red habit of her early married life.</p>

<p>Jane Austen was now between thirty-three and
thirty-four years old. She was absolutely free from any
artistic self-consciousness, from any eccentricity of
either temper or manner. 'Hers was a mind well
balanced on a basis of good sense, sweetened by an
affectionate heart, and regulated by fixed principles;
so that she was to be distinguished from many other
amiable and sensible women only by that peculiar
genius which shines out clearly .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in her works.'<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
Her tastes were as normal as her nature. She read
English literature with eagerness, attracted by the
eighteenth-century perfection of style&mdash;and still more
by the return to nature in Cowper and the introduction
of romance in Scott&mdash;but repelled by coarseness, which
she found even in the <i>Spectator</i>, and the presence of
which in Fielding made her rank him below Richardson.
As for the latter, 'Every circumstance narrated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
in <i>Sir Charles Grandison</i>, all that was ever said or done
in the "Cedar Parlour," was familiar to her; and the
wedding days of Lady L. and Lady G. were as well
remembered as if they had been living friends.' Her
'dear Dr. Johnson' was a constant companion;
and a younger friend was found in Crabbe, whom&mdash;as
she used to pretend&mdash;she was quite prepared to
marry: not knowing at the time whether he had a
wife living or not.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> As to her other tastes, she greatly
delighted in the beauties of nature, and no doubt would
have enjoyed foreign travel, had not that pleasure
been quite out of her reach. Her attitude to music,
as an art, is more doubtful. She learnt to play the
piano in her youth, and after spending many years
without an instrument, took it up again on settling
at Chawton; but she says herself that she did this
in order to be able to play country-dances for her
nephews and nieces; and when she goes to a concert
she sometimes remarks on her inability to enjoy
it. A concert in Sydney Gardens, however, was
not perhaps likely to offer to the hearer many
examples of high art; and we have no means of
knowing whether, if she had had a chance of being
introduced to classical music, it would have appealed
to her, as it sometimes does to intellectual people
who have been previously quite ignorant that they
possessed any musical faculty. We are told that
she had a sweet voice, and sang with feeling. 'The
Soldier's Adieu' and 'The Yellow-haired Laddie'
survive as the names of two of her songs.</p>

<p>She was extraordinarily neat-handed in anything
which she attempted. Her hand-writing was
both strong and pretty; her hemming and stitching,
over which she spent much time, 'might have put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
a sewing-machine to shame'; and at games, like
spillikins or cup-and-ball, she was invincible.</p>

<p>If this description does not seem to imply so wide
a mental outlook as we wish to see in a distinguished
author, we must remember that Jane Austen (as her
nephew tells us) 'lived in entire seclusion from the
literary world,' and probably 'never was in company
with any person whose talents or whose celebrity
equalled her own.'<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> She was in the middle of a small
family circle, the members of which were well-educated
according to the fashion of the times,
intelligent, and refined; but not especially remarkable
for learning or original thought. They accepted the
standards and views of their generation, interpreting
them in a reasonable and healthy manner. She had
therefore no inducement, such as might come from
the influence of superior intellects, to dive into
difficult problems. Her mental efforts were purely
her own, and they led her in another direction; but
she saw what she did see so very clearly, that she
would probably have been capable of looking more
deeply into the heart of things, had any impulse from
outside induced her to try. Her vision, however,
might not have remained so admirably adapted for
the delicate operations nearer to the surface which
were her real work in life.</p>

<p>Jane's person is thus described for us by her niece
Anna, now becoming a grown-up girl and a keen
observer: 'The figure tall and slight, but not
drooping; well balanced, as was proved by her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
quick firm step. Her complexion of that rare sort
which seems the particular property of light brunettes;
a mottled skin, not fair, but perfectly clear and
healthy; the fine naturally curling hair, neither light
nor dark; the bright hazel eyes to match, and the
rather small, but well-shaped, nose.' This is a
delightful description; but she adds that in spite of
all this, her aunt was not regularly handsome, though
most attractive. As to her charm and lovableness
there is absolute unanimity among all those who were
near enough to her to know what she really was.
Jane had by this time seen a good deal of society, and
enjoyed it, though with a certain critical aloofness
which belonged to her family, and which was hardly
to be avoided by so clever a person as herself. This
critical spirit was evidently a quality of which she
endeavoured to rid herself as of a fault; and one of her
nieces, who was too young to know her aunt intimately,
until almost the end of her life, was able then to say:
'She was in fact one of the last people in society to be
afraid of. I do not suppose she ever in her life said a
sharp thing. She was naturally shy and not given to
talk much in company, and people fancied, knowing
that she was clever, that she was on the watch for
good material for books from their conversation.
Her intimate friends knew how groundless was the
apprehension and that it wronged her.' She was not
only shy: she was also at times very grave. Her
niece Anna is inclined to think that Cassandra was
the more equably cheerful of the two sisters. There
was, undoubtedly, a quiet intensity of nature in Jane
for which some critics have not given her credit.
Yet at other times she and this same niece could joke
so heartily over their needlework and talk such nonsense
together that Cassandra would beg them to stop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
out of mercy to her, and not keep her in such fits of
laughing. Sometimes the laughter would be provoked
by the composition of extempore verses, such as
those given in the <i>Memoir</i><a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> celebrating the charm of
the 'lovely Anna'; sometimes the niece would skim
over new novels at the Alton Library, and reproduce
them with wilful exaggeration. On one occasion she
threw down a novel on the counter with contempt,
saying she knew it must be rubbish from its name.
The name was <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>&mdash;the secret of
which had been strictly kept, even from her.</p>

<p>The niece who shared these hearty laughs with
her aunts&mdash;James's eldest daughter, Anna&mdash;differed
widely from her cousin, Edward's daughter, Fanny.
She was more brilliant both in looks and in intelligence,
but also more mercurial and excitable. Both
occupied a good deal of Jane's thoughts and affections;
but Anna must have been the one who caused her
the most amusement and also the most anxiety.
The interest in her was heightened when she became
engaged to the son of Jane's old friend, Mrs. Lefroy.
Anna's giddiness was merely that of youth; she
settled down into a steady married life as the careful
mother of a large family. She cherished an ardent
affection for her Aunt Jane, who evidently exercised
a great influence on her character.</p>

<p>Jane Austen's literary work was done mainly in
the general sitting-room: liable at any moment to
be interrupted by servants, children, or visitors&mdash;to
none of whom had been entrusted the secret of her
authorship. Her small sheets of paper could easily
be put away or covered with blotting-paper, whenever
the creaking swing-door (which she valued for
that reason) gave notice that anyone was coming.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>
<p>Her needlework was nearly always a garment
for the poor; though she had also by her some satin
stitch ready to take up in case of the appearance
of company. The nature of the work will help to
contradict an extraordinary misconception&mdash;namely,
that she was indifferent to the needs and claims of
the poor: an idea probably based on the fact that she
never used them as 'copy.' Nothing could be further
from the truth. She was of course quite ignorant of
the conditions of life in the great towns, and she had
but little money to give, but work, teaching, and
sympathy were freely bestowed on rustic neighbours.
A very good criterion of her attitude towards her
own characters is often furnished by their relations
with the poor around them. Instances of this may
be found in Darcy's care of his tenants and servants,
in Anne Elliot's farewell visits to nearly all the
inhabitants of Kellynch, and in Emma's benevolence
and good sense when assisting her poorer neighbours.</p>

<p>So began the Austens' life at Chawton&mdash;probably a
quieter life than any they had yet led; their nearest
neighbours being the Middletons (who rented the
'Great House' for five years and were still its inmates),
the Benns at Faringdon, the Harry Digweeds,
Mr. Papillon the Rector (a bachelor living with his
sister), and the Clements and Prowting families.</p>

<p>The ladies took possession of their cottage on
July 7, and the first news that we have of them is in
a letter from Mrs. Knight, dated October 26, 1809: 'I
heard of the Chawton party looking very comfortable
at breakfast from a gentleman who was travelling
by their door in a post-chaise about ten days ago.'</p>

<p>After this the curtain falls again, and we have no
letters and no information for a year and a half from
this time. We are sure, however, that Jane settled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
down to her writing very soon, for by April 1811
<i>Sense and Sensibility</i> was in the printers' hands,
and <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> far advanced.</p>

<p>Since her fit of youthful enthusiasm, when she
had composed three stories in little more than three
years, she had had much experience of life to sober
and strengthen her. Three changes of residence, the
loss of her father, the friendship of Mrs. Lefroy and
the shock of her death,<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> her own and her sister's
sad love stories, the crisis in the Leigh Perrot history,
and her literary disappointments&mdash;all these must
have made her take up her two old works with
a chastened spirit, and a more mature judgment.
We cannot doubt that extensive alterations were
made: in fact, we know that this was the case
with <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>. We feel equally certain
that, of the two works, <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> was
essentially the earlier, both in conception and in
composition, and that no one could have sat
down to write that work who had already written
<i>Pride and Prejudice</i>.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> There is, indeed, no lack of
humour in the earlier work&mdash;the names of Mrs.
Jennings, John Dashwood, and the Palmers are
enough to assure us of this; but the humorous parts
are not nearly so essential to the story as they become
in her later novels: the plot is desultory, and the
principal characters lack interest. We feel, in the
presence of the virtue and sense of Elinor, a rebuke
which never affects us in the same way with Jane
Bennet, Fanny Price, or Anne Elliot; while Marianne<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
is often exasperating. Edward Ferrars is rather
stiff; and Colonel Brandon is so far removed from us
that we never even learn his Christian name.</p>

<p>Mr. Helm<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> makes some acute remarks on the
freedom which Elinor shows in talking of embarrassing
subjects with Willoughby, and on her readiness to
attribute his fall to the world rather than to himself.
We are to imagine, however, that Elinor had been
attracted by him before, and felt his personal charm
again while she was under its spell: all the more,
because she was herself in a special state of excitement,
from the rapid changes in Marianne's condition, and
the expectation of seeing her mother. Her excuses for
Willoughby were so far from representing any opinion
of the author's, that they did not even represent her
own after a few hours of reflection. It is one of the
many instances which we have of Jane Austen's
subtle dramatic instinct.</p>

<p>On the whole, there is great merit in the book,
and much amusement to be got from it; but it seems
natural to look upon it as an experiment on the part
of the author, before she put forth her full powers
in <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>. We are glad, by the way,
to hear from Jane herself that Miss Steele never
caught the Doctor after all.</p>

<p>We must now accompany the author to London,
whither she went in April 1811 to stay with her
brother Henry and his wife (who had moved from
Brompton to 64 Sloane Street), having been preceded
by her novel, then in the hands of the printers.</p>

<p>Cassandra had in the meanwhile gone to Godmersham.</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
<div class='right'><br />Sloane Street: Thursday [April 18, 1811].
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cassandra</span>,&mdash; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The badness of the
weather disconcerted an excellent plan of mine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>&mdash;that
of calling on Miss Beckford again; but from
the middle of the day it rained incessantly. Mary<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>
and I, after disposing of her father and mother, went
to the Liverpool Museum<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> and the British Gallery,<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>
and I had some amusement at each, though my
preference for men and women always inclines me
to attend more to the company than the sight.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I did not see Theo.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> till late on Tuesday; he was
gone to Ilford, but he came back in time to show his
usual nothing-meaning, harmless, heartless civility.
Henry, who had been confined the whole day to the
bank, took me in his way home, and, after putting
life and wit into the party for a quarter of an hour,
put himself and his sister into a hackney coach.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Eliza is walking out by herself. She has plenty
of business on her hands just now, for the day of the
party is settled, and drawing near. Above 80
people are invited for next Tuesday evening, and
there is to be some very good music&mdash;five professionals,
three of them glee singers, besides amateurs.
Fanny will listen to this. One of the hirelings
is a Capital on the harp, from which I expect
great pleasure. The foundation of the party was
a dinner to Henry Egerton and Henry Walter,<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>
but the latter leaves town the day before. I am
sorry, as I wished <i>her</i> prejudice to be done away,
but should have been more sorry if there had been
no invitation.</p>

<p>I am a wretch, to be so occupied with all these
things as to seem to have no thoughts to give to
people and circumstances which really supply a far
more lasting interest&mdash;the society in which you
are; but I do think of you all, I assure you, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
want to know all about everybody, and especially
about your visit to the W. Friars<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>; 'mais le moyen'
not to be occupied by one's own concerns?</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;Frank is superseded in the <i>Caledonia</i>.
Henry brought us this news yesterday
from Mr. Daysh, and he heard at the same time
that Charles may be in England in the course of a
month. Sir Edward Pollen succeeds Lord Gambier
in his command, and some captain of his succeeds
Frank; and I believe the order is already gone
out. Henry means to enquire farther to-day. He
wrote to Mary on the occasion. This is something
to think of. Henry is convinced that he will have
the offer of something else,<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> but does not think it
will be at all incumbent on him to accept it; and
then follows, what will he do? and where will he
live?</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The D'Antraigues and Comte Julien cannot come
to the party, which was at first a grief, but she has
since supplied herself so well with performers that it
is of no consequence; their not coming has produced
our going to them to-morrow evening, which I like
the idea of. It will be amusing to see the ways of
a French circle.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Our first object to-day was Henrietta St., to
consult with Henry in consequence of a very unlucky
change of the play for this very night&mdash;<i>Hamlet</i>
instead of <i>King John</i>&mdash;and we are to go on Monday
to <i>Macbeth</i> instead; but it is a disappointment to
us both.</p>

<div class='signature'>
Love to all.
</div>


<div class='right'><br />Thursday [April 25, 1811].<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
</div></div>



<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>No, indeed, I am never too busy to think of
<i>S. and S.</i><a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> I can no more forget it than a mother
can forget her sucking child; and I am much obliged
to you for your enquiries. I have had two sheets
to correct, but the last only brings us to Willoughby's
first appearance. Mrs. K. regrets in the most flattering
manner that she must wait <i>till</i> May, but I
have scarcely a hope of its being out in June. Henry
does not neglect it; he <i>has</i> hurried the printer, and
says he will see him again to-day. It will not stand
still during his absence, it will be sent to Eliza.</p>

<p>The <i>Incomes</i> remain as they were, but I will
get them altered if I can. I am very much gratified
by Mrs. K.'s interest in it; and whatever may
be the event of it as to my credit with her, sincerely
wish her curiosity could be satisfied sooner than
is now probable. I think she will like my Elinor,
but cannot build on anything else.</p>

<p>Our party went off extremely well. There were
many solicitudes, alarms, and vexations, beforehand,
of course, but at last everything was quite
right. The rooms were dressed up with flowers,
&amp;c., and looked very pretty. A glass for the
mantelpiece was lent by the man who is making
their own. Mr. Egerton and Mr. Walter came at
half-past five, and the festivities began with a pair
of very fine soles.</p>

<p>Yes, Mr. Walter&mdash;for he postponed his leaving
London on purpose&mdash;which did not give much
pleasure at the time, any more than the circumstance
from which it rose&mdash;his calling on Sunday
and being asked by Henry to take the family dinner
on that day, which he did; but it is all smoothed
over now, and she likes him very well.</p>

<p>At half-past seven arrived the musicians in two
hackney coaches, and by eight the lordly company
began to appear. Among the earliest were George
and Mary Cooke, and I spent the greatest part of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
the evening very pleasantly with them. The drawing-room
being soon hotter than we liked, we
placed ourselves in the connecting passage, which
was comparatively cool, and gave us all the advantage
of the music at a pleasant distance, as well
as that of the first view of every new comer.</p>

<p>I was quite surrounded by acquaintance, especially
gentlemen; and what with Mr. Hampson,<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
Mr. Seymour, Mr. W. Knatchbull, Mr. Guillemarde,
Mr. Cure, a Captain Simpson, brother to <i>the</i> Captain
Simpson, besides Mr. Walter and Mr. Egerton, in
addition to the Cookes, and Miss Beckford, and
Miss Middleton, I had quite as much upon my hands
as I could do.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Including everybody we were sixty-six&mdash;which
was considerably more than Eliza had expected,
and quite enough to fill the back drawing-room
and leave a few to be scattered about in the other
and in the passage.</p>

<p>The music was extremely good. It opened (tell
Fanny) with 'Poike de Parp pin praise pof Prapela;'<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>
and of the other glees I remember, 'In
peace love tunes,' 'Rosabelle,' 'The Red Cross
Knight,' and 'Poor Insect.' Between the songs
were lessons on the harp, or harp and pianoforte
together; and the harp-player was Wiepart, whose
name seems famous, though new to me. There
was one female singer, a short Miss Davis, all in
blue, bringing up for the public line, whose voice
was said to be very fine indeed; and all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
performers gave great satisfaction by doing what
they were paid for, and giving themselves no airs.
No amateur could be persuaded to do anything.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>This said Captain Simpson told us, on the authority
of some other Captain just arrived from
Halifax, that Charles<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> was bringing the <i>Cleopatra</i>
home, and that she was probably by this time in the
Channel; but, as Captain S. was certainly in liquor,
we must not quite depend on it. It must give one
a sort of expectation, however, and will prevent
my writing to him any more. I would rather he
should not reach England till I am at home, and
the Steventon party gone.</p>

<p>My mother and Martha both write with great
satisfaction of Anna's behaviour. She is quite an
Anna with variations, but she cannot have reached
her last, for that is always the most flourishing and
showy; she is at about her third or fourth, which
are generally simple and pretty.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>We <i>did</i> go to the play after all on Saturday.
We went to the Lyceum, and saw the <i>Hypocrite</i>,
an old play taken from Moli&egrave;re's <i>Tartuffe</i>, and were
well entertained. Dowton and Mathews were the
good actors; Mrs. Edwin was the heroine, and her
performance is just what it used to be. I have
no chance of seeing Mrs. Siddons; she <i>did</i> act
on Monday, but, as Henry was told by the box-keeper
that he did not think she would, the
plans, and all thought of it, were given up.
I should particularly have liked seeing her in
<i>Constance</i>, and could swear at her with little effort
for disappointing me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>Eliza caught her cold on Sunday in our way to
the D'Antraigues.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> The horses actually gibbed on
this side of Hyde Park Gate: a load of fresh gravel
made it a formidable hill to them, and they refused
the collar; I believe there was a sore shoulder to
irritate. Eliza was frightened and we got out, and
were detained in the evening air several minutes.
The cold is in her chest, but she takes care of
herself, and I hope it may not last long.</p>

<p>This engagement prevented Mr. Walter's staying
late&mdash;he had his coffee and went away. Eliza
enjoyed her evening very much, and means to
cultivate the acquaintance; and I see nothing to
dislike in them but their taking quantities of snuff.
Monsieur, the old Count, is a very fine-looking
man, with quiet manners, good enough for an
Englishman, and, I believe, is a man of great information
and taste. He has some fine paintings,
which delighted Henry as much as the son's music
gratified Eliza; and among them a miniature of
Philip V. of Spain, Louis XIV.'s grandson, which
exactly suited <i>my</i> capacity. Count Julien's performance
is very wonderful.</p>

<p>We met only Mrs. Latouche and Miss East, and
we are just now engaged to spend next Sunday
evening at Mrs. L.'s, and to meet the D'Antraigues,
but M. le Comte must do without Henry. If he
would but speak English, <i>I</i> would take to him.

<div class='right'><br />Sloane Street: [Tuesday, April 30, 1811].
</div>

<p>My head-dress was a bugle-band like the border
to my gown, and a flower of Mrs. Tilson's. I depended
upon hearing something of the evening from
Mr. W. K[natchbull], and am very well satisfied
with his notice of me&mdash;'A pleasing-looking young
woman'&mdash;that must do; one cannot pretend to anything
better now; thankful to have it continued a
few years longer!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>We have tried to get <i>Self-Control</i>,<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> but in vain.
I <i>should</i> like to know what her estimate is, but am
always half afraid of finding a clever novel <i>too
clever</i>, and of finding my own story and my own
people all forestalled.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I forgot to tell you in my last that our cousin,
Miss Payne,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> called in on Saturday, and was persuaded
to stay dinner. She told us a great deal
about her friend Lady Cath. Brecknell, who is
most happily married, and Mr. Brecknell is very
religious, and has got black whiskers.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 3em;">Yours very affectionately,</span><br />

<span class="smcap">Jane.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Early in May, Jane left London; and, after paying
a short visit to Mrs. Hill (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Catherine Bigg) at
Streatham, returned home to Chawton, where she
found only her mother and her niece Anna.</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
<div class='right'><br />Chawton: Wednesday [May 29, 1811].
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cassandra</span>,&mdash; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You certainly must
have heard before I can tell you that Col. Orde has
married our cousin, Margt. Beckford,<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> the Marchess.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
of Douglas's sister. The papers say that her father
disinherits her, but I think too well of an Orde to
suppose that she has not a handsome independence
of her own.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>We sat upstairs [at the Digweeds'] and had thunder
and lightning as usual. I never knew such a spring
for thunderstorms as it has been. Thank God! we
have had no bad ones here. I thought myself in
luck to have my uncomfortable feelings shared by
the mistress of the house, as that procured blinds
and candles. It had been excessively hot the whole
day. Mrs. Harding is a good-looking woman, but
not much like Mrs. Toke, inasmuch as she is very
brown and has scarcely any teeth; she seems to
have some of Mrs. Toke's civility. Miss H. is an
elegant, pleasing, pretty-looking girl, about nineteen,
I suppose, or nineteen and a half, or nineteen
and a quarter, with flowers in her head and music
at her finger ends. She plays very well indeed.
I have seldom heard anybody with more pleasure.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Friday [May 31].
</div>

<p>I have taken your hint, slight as it was, and have
written to Mrs. Knight, and most sincerely do I
hope it will not be in vain. I cannot endure the
idea of her giving away her own wheel, and have
told her no more than the truth, in saying that I
could never use it with comfort. I had a great mind
to add that, if she persisted in giving it, I would spin
nothing with it but a rope to hang myself, but I was
afraid of making it appear a less serious matter of
feeling than it really is.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>From Monday to Wednesday Anna is to be
engaged at Faringdon, in order that she may come
in for the gaieties of Tuesday (the 4th), on Selborne
Common, where there are to be volunteers and
felicities of all kinds. Harriet B[enn] is invited to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
spend the day with the John Whites, and her father
and mother have very kindly undertaken to get
Anna invited also.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Poor Anna is suffering from <i>her</i> cold, which is
worse to-day, but as she has no sore throat I hope it
may spend itself by Tuesday. She had a delightful
evening with the Miss Middletons&mdash;syllabub, tea,
coffee, singing, dancing, a hot supper, eleven o'clock,
everything that can be imagined agreeable. She
desires her best love to Fanny, and will answer her
letter before she leaves Chawton, and engages to send
her a particular account of the Selborne day.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>How horrible it is to have so many people killed!<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>
And what a blessing that one cares for none of them!</p>

<p>I return to my letter-writing from calling on
Miss Harriot Webb, who is short and not quite straight
and cannot pronounce an <span class="smcap">r</span> any better than her
sisters; but she has dark hair, a complexion to suit,
and, I think, has the pleasantest countenance and
manner of the three&mdash;the most natural. She appears
very well pleased with her new home, and they
are all reading with delight Mrs. H. More's recent
publication.</p>

<p>You cannot imagine&mdash;it is not in human nature
to imagine&mdash;what a nice walk we have round the
orchard. The row of beech look very well indeed,
and so does the young quickset hedge in the garden.
I hear to-day that an apricot has been detected on
one of the trees. My mother is perfectly convinced
<i>now</i> that she shall not be overpowered by her cleftwood,
and I believe would rather have more than less.</p>

<p>God bless you, and I hope June will find you
well, and bring us together.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<div class='right'><br />Thursday [June 6].
</div>

<p>[Anna] does not return from Faringdon till this
evening, and I doubt not has had plenty of the miscellaneous,
unsettled sort of happiness which seems
to suit her best. We hear from Miss Benn, who was
on the Common with the Prowtings, that she was
very much admired by the gentlemen in general.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>We began pease<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> on Sunday, but our gatherings
are very small, not at all like the gathering in the
<i>Lady of the Lake</i>. Yesterday I had the agreeable
surprise of finding several scarlet strawberries quite
ripe; had <i>you</i> been at home, this would have been a
pleasure lost. There are more gooseberries and fewer
currants than I thought at first. We must buy
currants for our wine.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I had just left off writing and put on my things
for walking to Alton, when Anna and her friend
Harriot called in their way thither, so we went
together. Their business was to provide mourning
against the King's death, and my mother has had
a bombasin bought for her. I am not sorry to be
back again, for the young ladies had a great deal to
do, and without much method in doing it.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Yours affectionately,</span><br />

</div></div>

<p>The printing of <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> cannot have
been very rapid, for in September 28 there is the
following entry in Fanny Austen's diary: 'Letter
from At. Cass to beg we would not mention that
Aunt Jane wrote <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>.' This looks
as if it were still on the eve of publication, and it
was not in fact advertised until October 31.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3><i>PRIDE AND PREJUDICE</i></h3>

<h3>1812-1814</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>The</span> title-page of <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> describes the
book as being 'by a Lady.' This ascription satisfied
the author's desire for concealment, but it puzzled
the advertisers. The first advertisement&mdash;that in
the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> on October 31, 1811&mdash;merely
describes it as 'a novel, called <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>,
by Lady &mdash;&mdash;.' In the same paper, on November 7,
it is styled an 'extraordinary novel by Lady &mdash;&mdash;';
while on November 28 it sinks to being an 'interesting
novel,' but is ascribed to 'Lady A.'<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></div>

<p>Jane's expectations were so modest that she laid
by a sum out of her very slender resources to meet the
expected loss. She must have been delighted at the
result. By July 1813 every copy of the first edition
had been sold; and not only had her expenses been
cleared but she was one hundred and forty pounds
to the good.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> If we compare this with the thirty
pounds that Fanny Burney received for <i>Evelina</i>,
the one hundred pounds that Maria Edgeworth got
for <i>Castle Rackrent</i>, or the hundred and forty pounds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
gained by Miss Ferrier for her first novel, we shall
see that Jane Austen had no reason to complain.</p>

<p>The money was no doubt very welcome; but still
more important from another point of view was the
favourable reception of the work. Had it been a
failure and an expense to its author, she would hardly
have dared, nor could she have afforded, to make
a second venture. On the success of <i>Sense and
Sensibility</i>, we may say, depended the existence of
<i>Pride and Prejudice</i>. Now she could return with
renewed spirit to the preparation of the more
famous work which was to follow, and on which
she had already been engaged for some time,
concurrently with her first-published novel.</p>

<p>We have no letters and little news for 1812; but we
know that in April Edward Austen and his daughter
Fanny came to Chawton House for three weeks. It
was their last visit as Austens; for on the death of Mrs.
Knight&mdash;his kind and generous patron and friend&mdash;in
October of that year, Edward and all his family took
the name of Knight<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>: a name which had been borne
by every successive owner of the Chawton Estate since
the sixteenth century. In June, Jane went with her
mother to stay for a fortnight at Steventon Rectory&mdash;the
last visit ever paid by Mrs. Austen to any
place. When she determined never to leave home
again, she said that her latest visit should be to her
eldest son. Accordingly she went, and took a final
farewell of the place where nearly the whole of her
married life had been spent. She was then seventy-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>two
years old, and lived on for sixteen more; but she
kept her resolution and never again left Chawton
Cottage for a single night. Her long survival can
hardly have been expected by those who had to nurse
her through frequent fits of illness; but these ailments
do not seem to have been of the sort that kills. She
was, however, always ready to contemplate the near
approach of death both for herself and others; for in
July 1811, after buying some bombazine in which to
mourn for the poor King, she said: 'If I outlive him
it will answer my purpose; if I do not, somebody may
mourn for me in it: it will be wanted for one or the
other, I dare say, before the moths have eaten it up.'
As it happened, the King lived nine more years, and
Mrs. Austen sixteen; and it was the lot of the latter
to lose two children before her own time came.
When Jane died in 1817, the health of her eldest
brother, James, was failing, and two years and a half
later he died. His mother lived on; but during the
last years of her life she endured continual pain not
only patiently but with characteristic cheerfulness.
She once said to her grandson, Edward Austen:
'Ah, my dear, you find me just where you left me&mdash;on
the sofa. I sometimes think that God Almighty
must have forgotten me; but I dare say He will
come for me in His own good time.'<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>Our letters recommence in January 1813&mdash;almost
at the exact date of the publication of <i>Pride and
Prejudice</i>&mdash;a date which will seem to many people
the central point in Jane Austen's life. She appeared,
indeed, to be rather of that opinion herself, so far as
her modest, unassuming nature would allow her to
attribute importance to one of her own works. She
calls it her 'darling child,' and does not know how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
she can tolerate people who will not care at least
for Elizabeth. But we had better let her speak
for herself. The first of the following letters<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> was
written before the publication took place; but the
others deal largely with <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, while
there is an under-current of allusions to <i>Mansfield
Park</i>&mdash;now approaching completion.</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
<div class='right'><br />Chawton: Sunday evening [January 24, 1813].
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cassandra</span>,&mdash;This is exactly the weather
we could wish for, if you are but well enough to enjoy
it. I shall be glad to hear that you are not confined
to the house by an increase of cold.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>We quite run over with books. My mother has
got Sir John Carr's <i>Travels in Spain</i> from Miss B.
and <i>I</i> am reading a Society octavo, <i>An Essay on the
Military Police and Institutions of the British Empire</i>
by Capt. Pasley of the Engineers: a book which
I protested against at first, but which upon trial
I find delightfully written and highly entertaining.
I am as much in love with the author as ever I was
with Clarkson or Buchanan, or even the two Mr.
Smiths of the City<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>&mdash;the first soldier I ever sighed for&mdash;but
he does write with extraordinary force and
spirit. Yesterday, moreover, brought us Mrs. Grant's
<i>Letters</i> with Mr. White's compliments; but I have
disposed of them, compliments and all, for the first
fortnight to Miss Papillon, and among so many
readers or retainers of books as we have in Chawton
I dare say there will be no difficulty in getting rid of
them for another fortnight if necessary. I learn from
Sir J. Carr that there is no Government House at
Gibraltar; I must alter it to the Commissioner's.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>
<p>Our party on Wednesday was not unagreeable.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
We were eleven altogether, as you will find on
computation, adding Miss Benn and two strange
gentlemen, a Mr. Twyford, curate of Great Worldham,
who is living in Alton, and his friend Mr. Wilkes.
I don't know that Mr. T. is anything except very
dark-complexioned, but Mr. W. was a useful addition,
being an easy, talking, pleasantish young man&mdash;a
<i>very</i> young man, hardly twenty, perhaps. He is of
St. John's, Cambridge, and spoke very highly of
H. Walter as a scholar. He said he was considered
as the best classic in the University. How
such a report would have interested my father!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Upon Mrs. D.'s mentioning that she had sent the
<i>Rejected Addresses</i> to Mr. H., I began talking to her
a little about them, and expressed my hope of their
having amused her. Her answer was 'Oh dear, yes,
very much, very droll indeed&mdash;the opening of the
House and the striking up of the fiddles!' What
she meant, poor woman, who shall say? I sought
no farther. The P.'s have now got the book, and like
it very much; their niece Eleanor has recommended
it most warmly to them&mdash;<i>She</i> looks like a rejected
addresser. As soon as a whist party was formed, and
a round table threatened, I made my mother an
excuse and came away, leaving just as many for <i>their</i>
round table as there were at Mrs. Grant's.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> I wish
they might be as agreeable a set.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The Miss Sibleys want to establish a Book Society
in their side of the country like ours. What can be
a stronger proof of that superiority in ours over the
Manydown and Steventon society, which I have
always foreseen and felt? No emulation of the kind
was ever inspired by <i>their</i> proceedings; no such
wish of the Miss Sibleys was ever heard in the course
of the many years of that Society's existence. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
what are their Biglands and their Barrows, their
Macartneys and Mackenzies to Captain Pasley's
<i>Essay on the Military Police of the British Empire</i>
and the <i>Rejected Addresses?</i></p>

<p>I have walked once to Alton, and yesterday Miss
Papillon and I walked together to call on the Garnets.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
<i>I</i> had a very agreeable walk, and if <i>she</i> had not,
more shame for her, for I was quite as entertaining
as she was. Dame G. is pretty well, and we found
her surrounded by her well-behaved, healthy, large-eyed
children. I took her an old shift, and promised
her a set of our linen, and my companion left some
of her Bank Stock with her.</p>

<p>Tell Martha that I hunt away the rogues every
night from under her bed; they feel the difference
of her being gone.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Friday [January 29, 1813].
</div>

<p>I hope you received my little parcel by J. Bond on
Wednesday evening, my dear Cassandra, and that you
will be ready to hear from me again on Sunday, for I
feel that I must write to you to-day.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I want to
tell you that I have got my own darling child from
London. On Wednesday I received one copy sent
down by Falkener, with three lines from Henry to
say that he had given another to Charles and sent
a third by the coach to Godmersham.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The advertisement is in our paper to-day for the
first time: 18<i>s.</i> He shall ask 1<i>l.</i> 1<i>s.</i> for my two next,
and 1<i>l.</i> 8<i>s.</i> for my stupidest of all.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> Miss Benn dined
with us on the very day of the book's coming, and in
the evening we set fairly at it, and read half the first
vol. to her, prefacing that, having intelligence from
Henry that such a work would soon appear, we had
desired him to send it whenever it came out, and
I believe it passed with her unsuspected. She was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
amused, poor soul! <i>That</i> she could not help, you
know, with two such people to lead the way, but
she really does seem to admire Elizabeth. I must
confess that I think her as delightful a creature as
ever appeared in print, and how I shall be able to
tolerate those who do not like <i>her</i> at least I do not
know. There are a few typical<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> errors; and a 'said he,'
or a 'said she,' would sometimes make the dialogue
more immediately clear; but&mdash;</p>



<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="I do not write for such dull elves">
<tr><td align='left'>I do not write for such dull elves</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p>The second volume is shorter than I could wish,
but the difference is not so much in reality as in
look, there being a larger proportion of narrative
in that part. I have lop't and crop't so successfully,
however, that I imagine it must be rather shorter than
<i>Sense and Sensibility</i> altogether. Now I will try and
write of something else; and it shall be a complete
change of subject&mdash;ordination.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> I am glad to find
your enquiries have ended so well. If you could
discover whether Northamptonshire is a country of
hedgerows, I should be glad again.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Thursday [February 4, 1813].
</div>

<p>Your letter was truly welcome, and I am much
obliged to you for all your praise; it came at a right
time, for I had had some fits of disgust. Our second
evening's reading to Miss Benn had not pleased me
so well, but I believe something must be attributed
to my mother's too rapid way of getting on: though
she perfectly understands the characters herself,
she cannot speak as they ought. Upon the whole,
however, I am quite vain enough and well-satisfied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
enough. The work is rather too light, and bright,
and sparkling; it wants shade; it wants to be
stretched out here and there with a long chapter of
sense, if it could be had; if not, of solemn specious
nonsense, about something unconnected with the
story; an essay on writing, a critique on Walter Scott,
or the history of Buonaparte, or anything that
would form a contrast, and bring the reader with increased
delight to the playfulness and epigrammatism
of the general style. I doubt your quite agreeing with
me here. I know your starched notions. The caution
observed at Steventon<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> with regard to the possession
of the book is an agreeable surprise to me, and I
heartily wish it may be the means of saving you from
anything unpleasant&mdash;but you must be prepared
for the neighbourhood being perhaps already informed
of there being such a work in the world and in the
Chawton world.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The greatest blunder in the printing
that I have met with is in page 220, l. 3, where
two speeches are made into one.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> There might as well
have been no supper at Longbourn; but I suppose it
was the remains of Mrs. Bennet's old Meryton habits.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Tuesday [February 9, 1813].
</div>

<p>This will be a quick return for yours, my dear
Cassandra; I doubt its having much else to recommend
it; but there is no saying; it may turn out to
be a very long and delightful letter.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I am exceedingly pleased that you can say what
you do, after having gone through the whole work,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
and Fanny's praise is very gratifying. My hopes
were tolerably strong of <i>her</i>, but nothing like a certainty.
Her liking Darcy and Elizabeth is enough.
She might hate all the others if she would. I have
her opinion under her own hand this morning, but
your transcript of it, which I read first, was not, and
is not, the less acceptable. To <i>me</i> it is of course all
praise, but the more exact truth which she sends <i>you</i>
is good enough.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I have been applied to for information as to the
oath taken in former times of Bell, Book, and Candle,
but have none to give. Perhaps you may be able
to learn something of its origin and meaning at
Manydown. Ladies who read those enormous great
stupid thick quarto volumes which one always sees in
the breakfast parlour there must be acquainted with
everything in the world. I detest a quarto. Capt.
Pasley's book is too good for their Society. They will
not understand a man who condenses his thoughts
into an octavo.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Miss Benn dined here on Friday. I have not seen
her since&mdash;there is still work for one evening more.
I know nothing of the P.'s. The C.'s are at home,
and are reduced to read. They have got Miss Edgeworth.
I have disposed of Mrs. Grant for the second
fortnight to Mrs. D. It can make no difference to <i>her</i>
which of the twenty-six fortnights in the year the
three volumes lay in her house.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Yours very affectionately,</span><br />

<span class="smcap">J. Austen.</span></div>

<p><small>Miss Austen, Manydown&mdash;by favour of Mr. Gray.</small></p>
</div>

<p>As she read and re-read <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, Jane
must have become aware (if she did not know it
before) that she had advanced far beyond <i>Sense and
Sensibility</i>. Indeed, the earlier work seems to fade<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
out of her mind, so far as allusions to its principal characters
are concerned; while those of the later novel
remain vivid and attractive to their creator. Even
the minor characters were real to her; and she forgot
nothing&mdash;down to the marriage of Kitty to a clergyman
near Pemberley, and that of Mary to one of
Uncle Philips's clerks.</p>

<p>In this work there seemed to be hardly anything
for which she need apologise. Here everything is complete;
the humour, though brilliant, is yet always
subordinate to the progress of the story; the plot is
inevitable, and its turning-point (the first proposal of
Darcy) occurs exactly when it ought; while all fear of
a commonplace ending is avoided by the insertion
of the celebrated interview between Lady Catherine
and Elizabeth. It gives us also an excellent example
of the way in which Jane Austen composed her
stories. We are always in the confidence of the
heroine, who is hardly off the stage throughout the
whole novel; we see the other characters with her
eyes, even when they are persons&mdash;like Jane Bennet&mdash;with
whom we believe ourselves to be intimately acquainted.
At the same time, such is the subtle irony
of the author that we are quite aware of her intention
to make us understand more of the heroine's state of
mind than the heroine herself does, and to distinguish
between her conscious and unconscious thoughts.
Elizabeth has to change from hatred to love&mdash;real
hatred and real love&mdash;in a volume and a half.
But it would wound her self-respect if she acknowledged
to herself that the pace at which she moved
was so rapid; and the change is constantly only
half admitted. Even near the end&mdash;when she says
that, if Darcy is prevented from seeking her hand
by the representations of Lady Catherine, she shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
soon cease to regret him&mdash;we know that this is far
from the truth: that her affection is really steadfast,
and that she is only trying to disguise from herself her
own anxiety. Other examples might easily be found.</p>

<p>On April 25, 1813, occurred the death of Eliza,
Henry Austen's wife. She had suffered from a long
and painful illness, and the end was 'a release at last.'
These circumstances would diminish the grief felt
at her loss; but the event must have carried their
minds back to early days at Steventon; and Jane
was sure to remember with gratitude the affection
and attention which Eliza had bestowed upon her
much younger cousin.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards, Henry went down to Chawton;
and on May 20 he drove Jane up to London in his
curricle. This was a short visit, and, owing to
Henry's being in deep mourning, no theatres were
visited. Jane went, however, to three picture-galleries&mdash;her
mind still full of Bennets and Darcys.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cassandra</span>,&mdash;Before I say anything
else, I claim a paper full of halfpence on the drawing-room
mantelpiece; I put them there myself, and
forgot to bring them with me. I cannot say that I
have yet been in any distress for money, but I chuse
to have my due, as well as the Devil. How lucky we
were in our weather yesterday! This wet morning
makes one more sensible of it. We had no rain of any
consequence. The head of the curricle was put half
up three or four times, but our share of the showers
was very trifling, though they seemed to be heavy
all round us, when we were on the Hog's-back, and I
fancied it might then be raining so hard at Chawton
as to make you feel for us much more than we
deserved. Three hours and a quarter took us to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
Guildford, where we staid barely two hours, and had
only just time enough for all we had to do there;
that is, eating a long, comfortable breakfast, watching
the carriages, paying Mr. Herington, and taking a
little stroll afterwards. From some views which that
stroll gave us, I think most highly of the situation
of Guildford. We wanted all our brothers and
sisters to be standing with us in the bowling-green,
and looking towards Horsham.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I was very lucky
in my gloves&mdash;got them at the first shop I went to,
though I went into it rather because it was near
than because it looked at all like a glove shop, and
gave only four shillings for them; upon hearing which
everybody at Chawton will be hoping and predicting
that they cannot be good for anything, and their
worth certainly remains to be proved; but I think
they look very well. We left Guildford at twenty
minutes before twelve (I hope somebody cares for
these minuti&aelig;), and were at Esher in about two hours
more. I was very much pleased with the country in
general. Between Guildford and Ripley I thought it
particularly pretty, also about Painshill and everywhere
else; and from a Mr. Spicer's grounds at
Esher, which we walked into before our dinner, the
views were beautiful. I cannot say what we did <i>not</i>
see, but I should think that there could not be a
wood, or a meadow, or palace, or a remarkable spot in
England that was not spread out before us on one side
or the other. Claremont is going to be sold: a Mr.
Ellis has it now. It is a house that seems never to
have prospered.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. After dinner we walked forward
to be overtaken at the coachman's time, and before
he did overtake us we were very near Kingston. I
fancy it was about half-past six when we reached this
house&mdash;a twelve hours' business, and the horses did not
appear more than reasonably tired. I was very tired
too, and very glad to get to bed early, but am quite
well to-day. I am very snug with the front drawing-room
all to myself, and would not say 'thank you'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
for any company but you. The quietness of it does
me good. I have contrived to pay my two visits,
though the weather made me a great while about it,
and left me only a few minutes to sit with Charlotte
Craven.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> She looks very well, and her hair is done up
with an elegance to do credit to any education. Her
manners are as unaffected and pleasing as ever. She
had heard from her mother to-day. Mrs. Craven
spends another fortnight at Chilton. I saw nobody
but Charlotte, which pleased me best. I was shewn
upstairs into a drawing-room, where she came to me,
and the appearance of the room, so totally unschool-like,
amused me very much; it was full of all the
modern elegancies.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Monday [May 24, 1813].
</div>

<p>I am very much obliged to you for writing to me.
You must have hated it after a worrying morning.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I went the day before to Layton's,<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> as I proposed,
and got my mother's gown&mdash;seven yards at 6<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> I
then walked into No. 10,<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> which is all dirt and confusion,
but in a very promising way, and after being
present at the opening of a new account, to my great
amusement, Henry and I went to the exhibition in
Spring Gardens. It is not thought a good collection,
but I was very well pleased, particularly (pray tell
Fanny) with a small portrait of Mrs. Bingley,<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>
excessively like her.</p>

<p>I went in hopes of seeing one of her sister, but
there was no Mrs. Darcy. Perhaps, however, I
may find her in the great exhibition, which we shall
go to if we have time. I have no chance of her
in the collection of Sir Joshua Reynolds's paintings,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
which is now showing in Pall Mall, and which we
are also to visit.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bingley's is exactly herself&mdash;size, shaped
face, features, and sweetness; there never was a
greater likeness. She is dressed in a white gown,
with green ornaments, which convinces me of what
I had always supposed, that green was a favourite
colour with her. I dare say Mrs. D. will be in yellow.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The events of yesterday were, our going to
Belgrave Chapel in the morning, our being prevented
by the rain from going to evening service at St.
James, Mr. Hampson's calling, Messrs. Barlow and
Phillips<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> dining here, and Mr. and Mrs. Tilson's<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> coming
in the evening <i>&agrave; l'ordinaire</i>. <i>She</i> drank tea with us
both Thursday and Saturday; <i>he</i> dined out each day,
and on Friday we were with them, and they wish
us to go to them to-morrow evening to meet Miss
Burdett, but I do not know how it will end. Henry
talks of a drive to Hampstead, which may interfere
with it.</p>

<p>I should like to see Miss Burdett very well, but
that I am rather frightened by hearing that she
wishes to be introduced to <i>me</i>. If I <i>am</i> a wild
beast I cannot help it. It is not my own fault.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Get us the best weather you can for Wednesday,
Thursday, and Friday. We are to go to Windsor
in our way to Henley, which will be a great delight.
We shall be leaving Sloane Street about 12, two or
three hours after Charles's party have begun their
journey. You will miss them, but the comfort of
getting back into your own room will be great. And
then the tea and sugar!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I am very much obliged to Fanny for her letter;
it made me laugh heartily, but I cannot pretend to
answer it. Even had I more time, I should not feel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
at all sure of the sort of letter that Miss D.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> would
write. I hope Miss Benn is got well again, and will
have a comfortable dinner with you to-day.</p>

<p><i>Monday Evening.</i>&mdash;We have been both to the
exhibition and Sir J. Reynolds's, and I am disappointed,
for there was nothing like Mrs. D. at either.
I can only imagine that Mr. D. prizes any picture
of her too much to like it should be exposed to the
public eye. I can imagine he would have that sort
of feeling&mdash;that mixture of love, pride, and delicacy.</p>

<p>Setting aside this disappointment, I had great
amusement among the pictures; and the driving
about, the carriage being open, was very pleasant.
I liked my solitary elegance very much, and was
ready to laugh all the time at my being where I was.
I could not but feel that I had naturally small right
to be parading about London in a barouche.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I should not wonder if we got no farther than
Reading on Thursday evening, and so reach Steventon
only to a reasonable dinner hour the next day; but
whatever I may write or you may imagine we know
it will be something different. I shall be quiet
to-morrow morning; all my business is done, and I
shall only call again upon Mrs. Hoblyn, &amp;c.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Yours affectionately,</span><br />

<span class="smcap">J. Austen.</span>

<p><small>Miss Austen, Chawton.</small></p>
</div></div>

<p>A very happy summer awaited the cottage party.
Godmersham wanted painting, and its owner moved
his family for some months to Chawton. There were
almost daily meetings between the two houses, and
the friendship between Fanny Knight and her Aunt
Jane became still closer as they spent 'delicious
mornings' together.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Frank, in command of the <i>Elephant</i>,
was stationed in the Baltic, and engaged sometimes
in convoying small vessels backwards and forwards,
sometimes in protecting the transports which took
Bernadotte's Swedish troops to the seat of war.</p>

<p>The following letter from his sister Jane reached
him no doubt in due course.</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
<div class='right'><br />Chawton: [July 3, 1813].<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dearest Frank</span>,&mdash;Behold me going to write
you as handsome a letter as I can! Wish me good
luck. We have had the pleasure of hearing from you
lately through Mary, who sent us some of the particulars
of yours of June 18 (I think), written off
Rugen, and we enter into the delight of your having
so good a pilot. Why are you like Queen Elizabeth?
Because you know how to chuse wise ministers.
Does not this prove you as great a Captain as she
was a Queen? This may serve as a riddle for you
to put forth among your officers, by way of increasing
your proper consequence. It must be a real enjoyment
to you, since you are obliged to leave England,
to be where you are, seeing something of a new
country and one which has been so distinguished as
Sweden. You must have great pleasure in it. I
hope you may have gone to Carlscroon. Your
profession has its <i>douceurs</i> to recompense for some
of its privations; to an enquiring and observing
mind like yours such <i>douceurs</i> must be considerable.
Gustavus Vasa, and Charles XII., and Cristina and
Linneus. Do their ghosts rise up before you? I
have a great respect for former Sweden, so zealous
as it was for Protestantism. And I have always
fancied it more like England than other countries;
and, according to the map, many of the names have
a strong resemblance to the English. July begins<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
unpleasantly with us, cold and showery, but it is
often a baddish month. We had some fine dry
weather preceding it, which was very acceptable to
the Holders of Hay, and the Masters of Meadows.
In general it must have been a good hay-making
season. Edward has got in all his in excellent order;
I speak only of Chawton, but here he has better
luck than Mr. Middleton ever had in the five
years that he was tenant. Good encouragement for
him to come again, and I really hope he will do so
another year. The pleasure to us of having them
here is so great that if we were not the best creatures
in the world we should not deserve it. We go on
in the most comfortable way, very frequently dining
together, and always meeting in some part of every
day. Edward is very well, and enjoys himself as
thoroughly as any Hampshire-born Austen can desire.
Chawton is not thrown away upon him.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>He will soon have all his children about him.
Edward, George and Charles are collected already,
and another week brings Henry and William.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>We are in hopes of another visit from our true
lawful Henry very soon; he is to be our guest this
time. He is quite well, I am happy to say, and does
not leave it to my pen, I am sure, to communicate
to you the joyful news of his being Deputy Receiver
no longer. It is a promotion which he thoroughly
enjoys, as well he may; the work of his own mind.
He sends you all his own plans of course. The
scheme for Scotland we think an excellent one both
for himself and his nephew.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> Upon the whole his
spirits are very much recovered. If I may so express
myself his mind is not a mind for affliction; he is
too busy, too active, too sanguine. Sincerely as he
was attached to poor Eliza moreover, and excellently
as he behaved to her, he was always so used to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
away from her at times, that her loss is not felt as
that of many a beloved wife might be, especially
when all the circumstances of her long and dreadful
illness are taken into the account. He very long
knew that she must die, and it was indeed a release
at last. Our mourning for her is not over, or we
should be putting it on again for Mr. Thomas
Leigh, who has just closed a good life at the age of
seventy-nine.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Poor Mrs. L. P. [Leigh Perrot] would now have
been mistress of Stoneleigh had there been none of
the vile compromise, which in good truth has never
been allowed to be of much use to them. It will be
a hard trial.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>You will be glad to hear that every copy of <i>S.
and S.</i> is sold, and that it has brought me &pound;140,
besides the copyright, if that should ever be of any
value. I have now, therefore, written myself into
&pound;250,<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> which only makes me long for more. I have
something in hand which I hope the credit of <i>P.
and P.</i> will sell well, though not half so entertaining,
and by the bye shall you object to my mentioning
the <i>Elephant</i> in it, and two or three other old ships?
I <i>have</i> done it, but it shall not stay to make you
angry. They are only just mentioned.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I hope you continue well and brush your hair,
but not all off.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Yours very affectionately,</span><br />

<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>Jane</span> was now about to pay what proved to be her
last visit to Godmersham. On the way thither she,
with one division of the Knight family party, halted
for a couple of days in London, to stay with Henry

Wednesday [September 15, 1813, 1/2 past 8].

<p>Here I am, my dearest Cassandra, seated in
the breakfast-, dining-, sitting-room, beginning with
all my might. Fanny will join me as soon as she is
dressed and begin her letter.</p>

<p>We arrived at a quarter-past four, and were
kindly welcomed by the coachman, and then by his
master, and then by William, and then by Mrs.
Perigord,<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> who all met us before we reached the foot
of the stairs. Mde. Bigeon was below dressing us a
most comfortable dinner of soup, fish, bouill&eacute;e, partridges,
and an apple tart, which we sat down to soon
after five, after cleaning and dressing ourselves, and
feeling that we were most commodiously disposed of.
The little adjoining dressing-room to our apartment
makes Fanny and myself very well off indeed, and as
we have poor Eliza's bed our space is ample every way.</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>Lady Robert is delighted with <i>P. and P.</i>,<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> and
really <i>was</i> so, as I understand, before she knew who
wrote it, for, of course, she knows now. He told her
with as much satisfaction as if it were my wish.
He did not tell <i>me</i> this, but he told Fanny. And
Mr. Hastings! I am quite delighted with what such
a man writes about it. Henry sent him the books
after his return from Daylesford, but you will hear
the letter too.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Fanny and the two little girls are gone to take
places for to-night at Covent Garden; <i>Clandestine
Marriage</i> and <i>Midas</i>. The latter will be a fine
show for L. and M.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> They revelled last night in
<i>Don Juan</i>, whom we left in hell at half-past eleven.
We had scaramouch and a ghost, and were delighted.
I speak of <i>them;</i> <i>my</i> delight was very tranquil, and
the rest of us were sober-minded. <i>Don Juan</i> was
the last of three musical things. <i>Five Hours at
Brighton</i>, in three acts&mdash;of which one was over
before we arrived, none the worse&mdash;and the <i>Beehive</i>,
rather less flat and trumpery.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Miss Hare had some pretty caps, and is to make
me one like one of them, only <i>white</i> satin instead
of blue. It will be white satin and lace, and a little
white flower perking out of the left ear, like Harriot
Byron's feather. I have allowed her to go as far as
&pound;1 16<i>s.</i> My gown is to be trimmed everywhere with
white ribbon plaited on somehow or other. She
says it will look well. I am not sanguine. They
trim with white very much.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Mr. Hall was very punctual yesterday, and
curled me out at a great rate. I thought it looked
hideous, and longed for a snug cap instead, but my
companions silenced me by their admiration.</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>We had very good places in the box next the
stage-box, front and second row; the three old ones
behind of course. I was particularly disappointed
at seeing nothing of Mr. Crabbe. I felt sure of
him when I saw that the boxes were fitted up with
crimson velvet.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It was not possible for me to get the worsteds
yesterday. I heard Edward last night pressing
Henry to come to [? Godmersham], and I think
Henry engaged to go there after his November collection.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>
Nothing has been done as to <i>S. and S.</i>
The books came to hand too late for him to have
time for it before he went.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I long to have you hear Mr. H.'s opinion of
<i>P. and P.</i> His admiring my Elizabeth so much is
particularly welcome to me.</p>

<p>
<small>Miss Austen, Chawton.</small>
</p></div>

<p>Her delight at the appreciation of her book by
Warren Hastings may be compared with a passage
from Madame d'Arblay's diary, which forms a curious
link between the two writers.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Mrs. Cooke [Jane Austen's cousin], my excellent

work [<i>Camilla</i>] and its author, it finishes thus:
'Mr. Hastings I saw just now; I told him what was
going forward; he gave a great jump and exclaimed:

<p>Thank you, my dearest Cassandra, for the nice

<p>We are now all four of us young ladies sitting
round the circular table in the inner room writing our

coze in the room adjoining. It is to be a quiet
evening, much to the satisfaction of four of the six.
My eyes are quite tired of dust and lamps.</p>

<p>We .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. went to Wedgwood's, where my brother

is a small lozenge in purple, between lines of
narrow gold, and it is to have the crest.</p>

<p>The journey from London to Godmersham was
no doubt duly narrated in a letter now missing.
Those from Godmersham are filled with the ordinary
comings and goings of a large family party, and
allusions to Kent neighbours&mdash;of whom Cassandra
would know just enough to be interested in their
proceedings.</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
<div class='right'><br />Godmersham Park:
Thursday [September 23, 1813].
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dearest Cassandra</span>,&mdash;Thank you five hundred
and forty times for the exquisite piece of
workmanship which was brought into the room this
morning, while we were at breakfast, with some very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
inferior works of art in the same way, and which I
read with high glee, much delighted with everything
it told, whether good or bad. It is so rich in striking
intelligence that I hardly know what to reply to first.
I believe finery must have it.</p>

<p>I am extremely glad that you like the poplin.
I thought it would have my mother's approbation,
but was not so confident of yours. Remember that
it is a present. Do not refuse me. I am very rich.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Let me know when you begin the new tea, and
the new white wine. My present elegancies have
not yet made me indifferent to such matters. I am
still a cat if I see a mouse.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>''Tis night, and the landscape is lovely no more,'
but to make amends for that, our visit to the Tyldens
is over. My brother, Fanny, Edwd., and I went;
Geo. stayed at home with W. K. There was nothing
entertaining, or out of the common way. We met
only Tyldens and double Tyldens. A whist-table
for the gentlemen, a grown-up musical young lady to
play backgammon with Fanny, and engravings of
the Colleges at Cambridge for me. In the morning
we returned Mrs. Sherer's visit. I like <i>Mr.</i> S.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> very
much.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Poor Dr. Isham is obliged to admire <i>P. and P.</i>,
and to send me word that he is sure he shall not like
Madame D'Arblay's new novel<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> half so well. Mrs.
C[ooke] invented it all, of course. He desires his
compliments to you and my mother.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I am now alone in the library, mistress of all I
survey; at least I may say so, and repeat the whole
poem if I like it, without offence to anybody.</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

circumstance or greater wit.</p>

<p>The next of Jane's surviving letters was addressed
to her brother Frank.</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
<div class='right'><br />Godmersham Park [September 25, 1813].<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dearest Frank</span>,&mdash;The 11th of this month
brought me your letter, and I assure you I thought
it very well worth its two and three-pence. I am
very much obliged to you for filling me so long a
sheet of paper; you are a good one to traffic with in
that way, you pay most liberally; my letter was a
scratch of a note compared to yours, and then you
write so even, so clear, both in style and penmanship,
so much to the point, and give so much intelligence,
that it is enough to kill one. I am sorry Sweden is
so poor, and my riddle so bad. The idea of a fashionable
bathing-place in Mecklenberg! How can people
pretend to be fashionable or to bathe out of England?
Rostock market makes one's mouth water; our
cheapest butcher's meat is double the price of theirs;
nothing under nine-pence all this summer, and I
believe upon recollection nothing under ten-pence.
Bread has sunk and is likely to sink more, which we
hope may make meat sink too. But I have no
occasion to think of the price of bread or of meat
where I am now; let me shake off vulgar cares and
conform to the happy indifference of East Kent
wealth. I wonder whether you and the King of
Sweden knew that I was come to Godmersham with
my brother. Yes, I suppose you have received due
notice of it by some means or other. I have not been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
here these four years, so I am sure the event deserves
to be talked of before and behind, as well as in the
middle. We left Chawton on the 14th, spent two
entire days in town, and arrived here on the 17th.
My brother, Fanny, Lizzie, Marianne and I composed
this division of the family, and filled his carriage
inside and out. Two post-chaises, under the escort
of George, conveyed eight more across the country,
the chair brought two, two others came on horseback,
and the rest by coach, and so by one means or another,
we all are removed. It puts me in remind of St.
Paul's shipwreck, when all are said, by different
means, to reach the shore in safety. I left my
mother, Cassandra, and Martha well, and have had
good accounts of them since. At present they are
quite alone, but they are going to be visited by Mrs.
Heathcote and Miss Bigg, and to have a few days of
Henry's company likewise.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Of our three evenings in town, one was spent at
the Lyceum, and another at Covent Garden. <i>The
Clandestine Marriage</i> was the most respectable of
the performances, the rest were sing-song and trumpery;
but it did very well for Lizzie and Marianne,
who were indeed delighted, but I wanted better
acting. There was no actor worth naming. I
believe the theatres are thought at a very low ebb
at present. Henry has probably sent you his own
account of his visit in Scotland. I wish he had had
more time, and could have gone further north, and
deviated to the lakes on his way back; but what he
was able to do seems to have afforded him great
enjoyment, and he met with scenes of higher beauty
in Roxburghshire than I had supposed the South of
Scotland possessed. Our nephew's gratification was
less keen than our brother's. Edward is no enthusiast
in the beauties of nature. His enthusiasm is
for the sports of the field only. He is a very promising
and pleasing young man, however, behaves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
with great propriety to his father, and great kindness
to his brothers and sisters, and we must forgive his
thinking more of grouse and partridges than lakes
and mountains.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In this house there is a constant succession of
small events, somebody is always going or coming;
this morning we had Edward Bridges unexpectedly
to breakfast with us, on his way from Ramsgate,
where is his wife, to Lenham, where is his church,
and to-morrow he dines and sleeps here on his return.
They have been all the summer at Ramsgate for her
health; she is a poor honey&mdash;the sort of woman who
gives me the idea of being determined never to be
well and who likes her spasms and nervousness, and
the consequence they give her, better than anything
else. This is an ill-natured statement to send all over
the Baltic. The Mr. Knatchbulls, dear Mrs. Knight's
brothers, dined here the other day. They came from
the Friars, which is still on their hands. The elder
made many inquiries after you. Mr. Sherer is quite
a new Mr. Sherer to me; I heard him for the first
time last Sunday, and he gave us an excellent sermon,
a little too eager sometimes in his delivery, but that
is to me a better extreme than the want of animation,
especially when it evidently comes from the heart,
as in him. The clerk is as much like you as ever.
I am always glad to see him on that account. But
the Sherers are going away. He has a bad curate at
Westwell, whom he can eject only by residing there
himself. He goes nominally for three years, and a
Mr. Paget is to have the curacy of Godmersham; a
married man, with a very musical wife, which I hope
may make her a desirable acquaintance to Fanny.</p>

<p>I thank you very warmly for your kind consent
to my application,<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> and the kind hint which followed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
it. I was previously aware of what I should be
laying myself open to; but the truth is that the
secret has spread so far as to be scarcely the shadow
of a secret now, and that, I believe, whenever the
third appears, I shall not even attempt to tell lies
about it. I shall rather try to make all the money
than all the mystery I can of it. People shall pay
for their knowledge if I can make them. Henry
heard <i>P. and P.</i> warmly praised in Scotland by
Lady Robert Kerr and another lady; and what
does he do, in the warmth of his brotherly vanity
and love, but immediately tell them who wrote it?
A thing once set going in that way&mdash;one knows how
it spreads, and he, dear creature, has set it going
so much more than once. I know it is all done
from affection and partiality, but at the same
time let me here again express to you and Mary
my sense of the <i>superior</i> kindness which you
have shown on the occasion in doing what I
wished. I am trying to harden myself. After all,
what a trifle it is, in all its bearings, to the
really important points of one's existence, even in
this world.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Your very affectionate sister,</span><br />
J. A.
</div></div>

<p>There is to be a second edition of <i>S. and S.</i>
Egerton advises it.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The last paragraph of this letter sets two things
plainly before us: a strong preference for remaining
unknown if she could, and the invariable sweetness
of temper which forbade her to blame a brother
whom she loved because he had made such concealment
impossible. That this acquiescence, however,
was not reached without a struggle the last few words
of the paragraph show.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>Next follows a letter to Cassandra, dated Monday
(October 11):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We had our dinner party on Wednesday, with the
addition of Mrs. and Miss Milles.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Both mother
and daughter are much as I have always found
them. I like the mother&mdash;first, because she reminds
me of Mrs. Birch; and, secondly, because she is
cheerful and grateful for what she is at the age of
ninety and upwards. The day was pleasant enough.
I sat by Mr. Chisholme, and we talked away at a
great rate about nothing worth hearing.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Lizzie is very much obliged to you for your
letter and will answer it soon, but has so many
things to do that it may be four or five days before
she can. This is quite her own message, spoken
in rather a desponding tone. Your letter gave
pleasure to all of us; we had all the reading of it
of course, I <i>three times</i>, as I undertook, to the great
relief of Lizzie, to read it to Sackree,<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> and afterwards
to Louisa.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; called here on Saturday. I never
saw her before. She is a large, ungenteel woman,
with self-satisfied and would-be elegant manners.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>On Thursday, Mr. Lushington,<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> M.P. for Canterbury,
and manager of the Lodge Hounds, dines
here, and stays the night. He is chiefly young
Edward's acquaintance. If I can I will get a
frank from him, and write to you all the sooner.
I suppose the Ashford ball will furnish something.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I am looking over <i>Self-Control</i> again, and my
opinion is confirmed of its being an excellently-meant,
elegantly-written work, without anything of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
nature or probability in it. I declare I do not
know whether Laura's passage down the American
river is not the most natural, possible, everyday
thing she ever does.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;I admire the sagacity and taste of
Charlotte Williams. Those large dark eyes always
judge well. I will compliment her by naming a
heroine after her.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Southey's <i>Life of Nelson:</i> I am tired of <i>Lives
of Nelson</i>, being that I never read any. I will read
this, however, if Frank is mentioned in it.</p>


<div class='right'><br />[October 14, 1813.]
</div>

<p>Now I will prepare for Mr. Lushington, and as
it will be wisest also to prepare for his not coming,
or my not getting a frank, I shall write very close
from the first, and even leave room for the seal
in the proper place. When I have followed up my
last with this I shall feel somewhat less unworthy
of you than the state of our correspondence now
requires.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Mr. W. is about five- or six-and-twenty, not
ill-looking, and not agreeable. He is certainly no
addition. A sort of cool, gentlemanlike manner,
but very silent. They say his name is Henry, a
proof how unequally the gifts of fortune are bestowed.
I have seen many a John and Thomas much more
agreeable.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>We did not go to the ball.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> It was left to her
to decide, and at last she determined against it.
She knew that it would be a sacrifice on the part
of her father and brothers if they went, and I hope
it will prove that <i>she</i> has not sacrificed much. It
is not likely that there should have been anybody
there whom she would care for. <i>I</i> was very glad
to be spared the trouble of dressing and going, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
being weary before it was half over, so my gown
and my cap are still unworn. It will appear at
last, perhaps, that I might have done without either.
I produced my brown bombazine yesterday, and it
was very much admired indeed, and I like it better
than ever.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The comfort of the billiard-table here is very
great; it draws all the gentlemen to it whenever
they are within, especially after dinner, so that my
brother, Fanny, and I have the library to ourselves
in delightful quiet.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;They<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> came last night at about seven.
We had given them up, but <i>I still</i> expected them to
come. Dessert was nearly over; a better time for
arriving than an hour and a half earlier. They were
late because they did not set out earlier, and did not
allow time enough. Charles did not <i>aim</i> at more
than reaching Sittingbourne by three, which could
not have brought them here by dinner time. They
had a very rough passage; he would not have
ventured if he had known how bad it would be.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>However, here they are, safe and well, just like
their own nice selves, Fanny looking as neat and
white this morning as possible, and dear Charles all
affectionate, placid, quiet, cheerful good humour.
They are both looking very well, but poor little
Cassy is grown extremely thin, and looks poorly.
I hope a week's country air and exercise may do
her good. I am sorry to say it can be but a week.
The baby does not appear so large in proportion
as she was, nor quite so pretty, but I have seen
very little of her. Cassy was too tired and bewildered
just at first to seem to know anybody. We met
them in the hall&mdash;the women and girl part of us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>&mdash;but
before we reached the library she kissed me very
affectionately, and has since seemed to recollect me
in the same way.</p>

<p>It was quite an evening of confusion, as you
may suppose. At first we were all walking about
from one part of the house to the other; then came
a fresh dinner in the breakfast-room for Charles and
his wife, which Fanny and I attended; then we
moved into the library, were joined by the dining-room
people, were introduced, and so forth; and
then we had tea and coffee, which was not over
till past 10. Billiards again drew all the odd ones
away, and Edward, Charles, the two Fannies, and
I sat snugly talking. I shall be glad to have our
numbers a little reduced, and by the time you receive
this we shall be only a family, though a large family,
party. Mr. Lushington goes to-morrow.</p>

<p>Now I must speak of <i>him</i>, and I like him very
much. I am sure he is clever, and a man of taste.
He got a volume of Milton last night, and spoke
of it with warmth. He is quite an M.P., very
smiling, with an exceeding good address and readiness
of language. I am rather in love with him. I
dare say he is ambitious and insincere. He puts
me in mind of Mr. Dundas. He has a wide smiling
mouth, and very good teeth, and something the
same complexion and nose.</p>

<div class='right'><br />[October 18, 1813.]
</div>

<p>No; I have never seen the death of Mrs. Crabbe.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>
I have only just been making out from one of his
prefaces that he probably was married. It is almost
ridiculous. Poor woman! I will comfort <i>him</i> as well
as I can, but I do not undertake to be good to her
children. She had better not leave any.</p>


<div class='right'><br />October 26.
</div>

<p>Our Canterbury scheme took place as proposed,
and very pleasant it was&mdash;Harriot and I and little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
George within, my brother on the box with the
master coachman.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Our chief business was to call on Mrs. Milles,
and we had, indeed, so little else to do that we were
obliged to saunter about anywhere and go backwards
and forwards as much as possible to make
out the time and keep ourselves from having two
hours to sit with the good lady&mdash;a most extraordinary
circumstance in a Canterbury morning.</p>

<p>Old Toke came in while we were paying our visit.
I thought of Louisa. Miss Milles was queer as usual,
and provided us with plenty to laugh at. She undertook
in <i>three words</i> to give us the history of Mrs.
Scudamore's reconciliation, and then talked on about
it for half an hour, using such odd expressions, and
so foolishly minute, that I could hardly keep my
countenance.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Owing to a difference of clocks the coachman did
not bring the carriage so soon as he ought by half
an hour; anything like a breach of punctuality was
a great offence, and Mr. Moore was very angry,
which I was rather glad of. I wanted to see him
angry; and, though he spoke to his servant in a very
loud voice and with a good deal of heat, I was happy
to perceive that he did not scold Harriot at all.
Indeed, there is nothing to object to in his manners
to her, and I do believe that he makes her&mdash;or she
makes herself&mdash;very happy. They do not spoil their
boy.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>George Hatton<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> called yesterday, and I saw him,
saw him for ten minutes; sat in the same room with
him, heard him talk, saw him bow, and was not
in raptures. I discerned nothing extraordinary. I
should speak of him as a gentlemanlike young man&mdash;<i>eh
bien! tout est dit.</i> We are expecting the ladies of
the family this morning.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<div class='right'><br />[November 3, 1813.]
</div>

<p>I will keep this celebrated birthday by writing
to you, and as my pen seems inclined to write
large, I will put my lines very close together. I had
but just time to enjoy your letter yesterday before
Edward and I set off in the chair for Canty., and I
allowed him to hear the chief of it as we went
along.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>But now I cannot be quite easy without staying
a little while with Henry, unless he wishes it otherwise;
his illness and the dull time of year together
make me feel that it would be horrible of me not to
offer to remain with him, and therefore unless you
know of any objection, I wish you would tell him
with my best love that I shall be most happy to
spend ten days or a fortnight in Henrietta St., if
he will accept me. I do not offer more than a
fortnight, because I shall then have been some
time from home; but it will be a great pleasure to
be with him, as it always is.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Edward and I had a delightful morning for our
drive <i>there</i> [to Canterbury], I enjoyed it thoroughly;
but the day turned off before we were ready, and we
came home in some rain and the apprehension of a
great deal. It has not done us any harm, however.
He went to inspect the gaol, as a visiting magistrate,
and took me with him. I was gratified, and went
through all the feelings which people must go through,
I think, in visiting such a building. We paid no
other visits, only walked about snugly together and
shopped. I bought a concert ticket and a sprig of
flowers for my old age.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>What a convenient carriage Henry's is, to his
friends in general! Who has it next? I am glad
William's going is voluntary, and on no worse grounds.
An inclination for the country is a venial fault. He
has more of Cowper than of Johnson in him&mdash;fonder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
of tame hares and blank verse than of the full tide
of human existence at Charing Cross.</p>

<p>Oh! I have more of such sweet flattery from Miss
Sharp. She is an excellent kind friend. I am read
and admired in Ireland, too. There is a Mrs. Fletcher,
the wife of a judge, an old lady, and very good
and very clever, who is all curiosity to know about
me&mdash;what I am like, and so forth. I am not known
to her by <i>name</i>, however. This comes through Mrs.
Carrick, not through Mrs. Gore. You are quite out
there.</p>

<p>I do not despair of having my picture in the
Exhibition at last&mdash;all white and red, with my head
on one side; or perhaps I may marry young Mr.
D'Arblay. I suppose in the meantime I shall owe
dear Henry a great deal of money for printing, &amp;c.</p>

<p>I hope Mrs. Fletcher will indulge herself with
<i>S. and S.</i></p>


<div class='right'><br />November 6.
</div>

<p>Having half an hour before breakfast (very snug
in my own room, lovely morning, excellent fire&mdash;fancy
me!) I will give you some account of the last
two days. And yet, what is there to be told? I shall
get foolishly minute unless I cut the matter short.</p>

<p>We met only the Bretons at Chilham Castle,
besides a Mr. and Mrs. Osborne and a Miss Lee staying
in the house, and were only fourteen altogether.
My brother and Fanny thought it the pleasantest
party they had ever known there, and I was very
well entertained by bits and scraps.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>By-the-bye, as I must leave off being young, I
find many <i>douceurs</i> in being a sort of <i>chaperon</i>, for
I am put on the sofa near the fire, and can drink as
much wine as I like. We had music in the evening:
Fanny and Miss Wildman played, and Mr. James
Wildman sat close by and listened, or pretended to
listen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Mrs. Harrison<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> and I found each other out,
and had a very comfortable little complimentary
friendly chat. She is a sweet woman&mdash;still quite a
sweet woman in herself, and so like her sister! I could
almost have thought I was speaking to Mrs. Lefroy.
She introduced me to her daughter, whom I think
pretty, but most dutifully inferior to <i>la M&egrave;re Beaut&eacute;</i>.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I was just introduced at last to Mary Plumptre,
but should hardly know her again. She was delighted
with <i>me</i>, however, good enthusiastic soul! And Lady
B. found me handsomer than she expected, so you
see I am not so very bad as you might think for.</p>

<p>Since I wrote last, my 2nd edit.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> has stared me
in the face. Mary tells me that Eliza means to buy
it. I wish she may. It can hardly depend upon
any more Fyfield Estates. I cannot help hoping that
<i>many</i> will feel themselves obliged to buy it. I shall
not mind imagining it a disagreeable duty to them,
so as they do it. Mary heard before she left home
that it was very much admired at Cheltenham, and
that it was given to Miss Hamilton.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> It is pleasant to
have such a respectable writer named. I cannot tire
<i>you</i>, I am sure, on this subject, or I would apologise.</p>

<p>What weather, and what news!<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> We have
enough to do to admire them both. I hope you
derive your full share of enjoyment from each.</p>

<p>Lady Eliz. Hatton and Annamaria called here
this morning. Yes, they called; but I do not think
I can say anything more about them. They came,
and they sat, and they went.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>Sunday</i>.&mdash;Excellent sweetness of you to send me
such a nice long letter; it made its appearance, with
one from my mother, soon after I and my impatient
feelings walked in. How glad I am that I did what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
I did! I was only afraid that <i>you</i> might think the
offer superfluous, but you have set my heart at ease.
Tell Henry that I <i>will</i> stay with him, let it be ever
so disagreeable to him.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>You shall hear from me once more, some day or
other.</p>

<p><small>Miss Austen, 10 Henrietta Street.</small></p>

<p>Even in the middle of this large family party,
Jane was not likely to forget the literary profession
which she had now seriously adopted. Indeed, it
was just at this time that the second edition of
<i>Sense and Sensibility</i>, on which she had ventured
under the advice of her publisher Egerton, appeared.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>
According to our dates, she was not now actually
engaged in regular composition&mdash;for <i>Mansfield Park</i><a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>
was completed 'soon after June 1813,' and <i>Emma</i>
was not begun till January 21, 1814. We may
guess, however, that she was either putting a few
humorous touches to Mrs. Norris and Lady Bertram,
or else giving herself hints in advance for Miss Bates
or Mr. Woodhouse; for we learn something of her
process from an eyewitness, her niece Marianne
Knight, who related her childish remembrances of
her aunt not very many years ago. 'Aunt Jane,'<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>
she said, 'would sit very quietly at work beside the
fire in the Godmersham library, then suddenly burst
out laughing, jump up, cross the room to a distant
table with papers lying upon it, write something down,
returning presently and sitting down quietly to her
work again.' She also remembered how her aunt
would take the elder girls into an upstairs room and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
read to them something that produced peals of
laughter, to which the little ones on the wrong side
of the door listened, thinking it very hard that they
should be shut out from hearing what was so
delightful! The laughter may have been the result
of the second novel then published, for there is an
entry in Fanny Knight's diary: 'We finished <i>Pride
and Prejudice</i>'; or it may have been caused by a
first introduction to Aunt Norris and Lady Bertram.
Happy indeed were those who could hear their creator
make her characters 'speak as they ought.' The
dramatic element in her works is so strong that for
complete enjoyment on a first acquaintance it is
almost indispensable that they should be read aloud
by some person capable of doing them justice. She
had this power herself, according to the concurrent
testimony of those who heard her, and she handed
it on to her nephew, the author of the <i>Memoir</i>.</p>

<p>On November 13 Jane left Godmersham with
Edward, spent two days with some connexions of
his at Wrotham, and reached London on the 15th,
in time to dine with Henry in Henrietta Street.</p>

<p>After that she had various plans; but we do not
know which she adopted; and there is nothing
further to tell of her movements until March 1814.
We know, however, that <i>Emma</i> was begun in
January; and that on March 2, when Henry drove
his sister up to London, spending a night at Cobham
on the way, he was engaged in reading <i>Mansfield
Park</i> for the first time. Jane was of course eager
to communicate Henry's impressions to Cassandra.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'><br />Henrietta Street: Wednesday [March 2, 1814].
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cassandra</span>,&mdash;You were wrong in
thinking of us at Guildford last night: we were at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
Cobham. On reaching G. we found that John and
his horses were gone on. We therefore did no more
there than we did at Farnham&mdash;sit in the carriage
while fresh horses were put in&mdash;and proceeded
directly to Cobham, which we reached by seven, and
about eight were sitting down to a very nice roast
fowl, &amp;c. We had altogether a very good journey,
and everything at Cobham was comfortable. I
could not pay Mr. Herington! That was the only
alas! of the business. I shall therefore return his
bill, and my mother's &pound;2, that you may try your
luck. We did not begin reading till Bentley Green.
Henry's approbation is hitherto even equal to my
wishes. He says it is very different from the other
two, but does not appear to think it at all inferior.
He has only married Mrs. R. I am afraid he has
gone through the most entertaining part. He took
to Lady B. and Mrs. N. most kindly, and gives great
praise to the drawing of the characters. He understands
them all, likes Fanny, and, I think, foresees
how it will all be. I finished the <i>Heroine</i><a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> last
night, and was very much amused by it. I wonder
James did not like it better. It diverted me exceedingly.
We went to bed at ten. I was very tired, but
slept to a miracle, and am lovely to-day, and at
present Henry seems to have no complaint. We left
Cobham at half-past eight, stopped to bait and breakfast
at Kingston, and were in this house considerably
before two, quite in the style of Mr. Knight. Nice
smiling Mr. Barlowe met us at the door and, in reply
to enquiries after news, said that peace was generally
expected. I have taken possession of my bedroom,
unpacked my bandbox, sent Miss P.'s two letters to
the twopenny post, been visited by M<sup>de</sup> Bigeon and
am now writing by myself at the new table in the
front room. It is snowing. We had some snow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>storms<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>
yesterday, and a smart frost at night, which
gave us a hard road from Cobham to Kingston; but
as it was then getting dirty and heavy, Henry had a
pair of leaders put on from the latter place to the
bottom of Sloane St. His own horses, therefore,
cannot have had hard work. I watched for <i>veils</i> as
we drove through the streets, and had the pleasure of
seeing several upon vulgar heads. And now, how
do you all do?&mdash;you in particular, after the worry of
yesterday and the day before. I hope Martha had
a pleasant visit again, and that you and my mother
could eat your beef-pudding. Depend upon my
thinking of the chimney-sweeper as soon as I wake
to-morrow. Places are secured at Drury Lane for
Saturday, but so great is the rage for seeing Kean<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>
that only a third and fourth row could be got; as it
is in a front box, however, I hope we shall do pretty
well&mdash;<i>Shylock</i>, a good play for Fanny&mdash;she cannot
be much affected, I think.</p>

<p>Mrs. Perigord has just been here. She tells me
that we owe her master for the silk-dyeing. My poor
old muslin has never been dyed yet. It has been
promised to be done several times. What wicked
people dyers are. They begin with dipping their
own souls in scarlet sin.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is evening. We
have drank tea, and I have torn through the third
vol. of the <i>Heroine</i>. I do not think it falls off.
It is a delightful burlesque, particularly on the
Radcliffe style. Henry is going on with <i>Mansfield
Park</i>. He admires H. Crawford: I mean properly, as
a clever, pleasant man. I tell you all the good I can,
as I know how much you will enjoy it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We
hear that Mr. Kean is more admired than ever.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
There are no good places to be got in Drury Lane for
the next fortnight, but Henry means to secure some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
for Saturday fortnight, when you are reckoned upon.
Give my love to little Cass. I hope she found my
bed comfortable last night. I have seen nobody
in London yet with such a long chin as Dr. Syntax,
nor anybody quite so large as Gogmagoglicus.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Saturday [March 5, 1814].
</div>

<p>Do not be angry with me for beginning another
letter to you. I have read the <i>Corsair</i>, mended
my petticoat, and have nothing else to do. Getting
out is impossible. It is a nasty day for everybody.
Edward's<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> spirits will be wanting sunshine, and here
is nothing but thickness and sleet; and though these
two rooms are delightfully warm, I fancy it is very
cold abroad.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;We were quite satisfied with Kean. I
cannot imagine better acting, but the part was too
short; and, excepting him and Miss Smith, and <i>she</i>
did not quite answer my expectation, the parts were
ill filled and the play heavy. We were too much
tired to stay for the whole of <i>Illusion</i> ('Nour-jahad'),
which has three acts; there is a great deal of finery
and dancing in it, but I think little merit. Elliston
was 'Nour-jahad,' but it is a solemn sort of part,
not at all calculated for his powers. There was
nothing of the <i>best</i> Elliston about him. I might
not have known him but for his voice.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Henry has this moment said that he likes my
<i>M. P.</i> better and better; he is in the third volume.
I believe <i>now</i> he has changed his mind as to foreseeing
the end; he said yesterday, at least, that he
defied anybody to say whether H. C. would be
reformed, or would forget Fanny in a fortnight.</p>

<p>I shall like to see Kean again excessively, and
to see him with you too. It appeared to me as if
there were no fault in him anywhere; and in his
scene with 'Tubal' there was exquisite acting.</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;You cannot think how much my ermine
tippet is admired both by father and daughter. It
was a noble gift.</p>

<p>Perhaps you have not heard that Edward has
a good chance of escaping his lawsuit. His opponent
'knocks under.' The terms of agreement are not
quite settled.</p>

<p>We are to see <i>The Devil to Pay</i> to-night. I expect
to be very much amused. Excepting Miss Stephens,
I daresay <i>Artaxerxes</i> will be very tiresome.</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Well, Mr. Hampson dined here, and all
that. I was very tired of <i>Artaxerxes</i>, highly amused
with the farce, and, in an inferior way, with the pantomime
that followed. Mr. J. Plumptre joined in the
latter part of the evening, walked home with us,
ate some soup, and is very earnest for our going to
Covent Garden again to-night to see Miss Stephens
in the <i>Farmer's Wife</i>. He is to try for a box. I do
not particularly wish him to succeed. I have had
enough for the present. Henry dines to-day with
Mr. Spencer.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Wednesday [March 9, 1814].
</div>

<p>Well, we went to the play again last night, and
as we were out a great part of the morning too,
shopping, and seeing the Indian jugglers, I am very
glad to be quiet now till dressing time. We are to
dine at the Tilsons', and to-morrow at Mr. Spencer's.</p>

<p>We had not done breakfast yesterday when Mr.
J. Plumptre appeared to say that he had secured a
box. Henry asked him to dine here, which I fancy
he was very happy to do, and so at five o'clock we
four sat down to table together while the master of
the house was preparing for going out himself. The
<i>Farmer's Wife</i> is a musical thing in three acts, and,
as Edward was steady in not staying for anything
more, we were at home before ten.</p>

<p>Fanny and Mr. J. P. are delighted with Miss
S[tephens], and her merit in singing is, I dare say, very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
great; that she gave <i>me</i> no pleasure is no reflection
upon her, nor, I hope, upon myself, being what
Nature made me on that article. All that I am
sensible of in Miss S. is a pleasing person and no
skill in acting. We had Mathews, Liston, and
Emery; of course, some amusement.</p>

<p>Our friends were off before half-past eight this
morning, and had the prospect of a heavy cold journey
before them. I think they both liked their visit very
much. I am sure Fanny did. Henry sees decided
attachment between her and his new acquaintance.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Henry has finished <i>Mansfield Park</i>, and his
approbation has not lessened. He found the last
half of the last volume <i>extremely interesting</i>.</p>

<p>On Friday we are to be snug with only Mr. Barlowe
and an evening of business. I am so pleased that
the mead is brewed. Love to all. I have written
to Mrs. Hill, and care for nobody.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Yours affectionately,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">J. Austen.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Henry must have read from a proof copy; for
<i>Mansfield Park</i> was not yet published, though on the
eve of being so. It was announced in the <i>Morning
Chronicle</i> on May 23, and we shall see from the first
letter in the next chapter that the Cookes had already
been reading it before June 13. It was probably a
small issue;<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> but whatever the size may have been,
it was entirely sold out in the autumn.</p>

<p>The author broke new ground in this work, which
(it should be remembered) was the first dating wholly
from her more mature Chawton period. Though
her novels were all of one type she had a remarkable
faculty for creating an atmosphere&mdash;differing more
or less in each book; and an excellent instance of
this faculty is afforded by the decorous, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
somewhat cold, dignity of Sir Thomas Bertram's
household. In this household Fanny Price grows up,
thoroughly appreciating its orderliness, but saved
by Edmund's affection and her own warmhearted
simplicity from catching the infection of its coldness.
She required, however, an experience of the
discomforts and vulgarity of Portsmouth to enable
her to value to the full the home which she had left.
In the first volume she had been too much of a
Cinderella to take her proper position in the family
party, and it was a real stroke of art to enhance the
dignity of the heroine through the courtship of a
rich and clever man of the world. A small point
worth noticing in the third volume is the manner in
which, when the horrible truth breaks in upon Fanny&mdash;and
upon the reader&mdash;the tension is relaxed by
Mrs. Price's commonplace remarks about the carpet.</p>

<p>Probably, most readers will look upon the
theatricals and the Portsmouth episode as the most
brilliant parts of the book; but the writing throughout
is full of point, and the three sisters&mdash;Lady Bertram,
Mrs. Norris, and Mrs. Price&mdash;are all productions
of the author's most delicately barbed satire. Mrs.
Norris, indeed, is an instance of her complex characters
so justly praised by Macaulay. One thinks of her
mainly as parsimonious; but her parsimony would
be worth much less than it is, if it were not set off
by her servility to Sir Thomas, her brutality to
Fanny, and her undisciplined fondness for her other
nieces. Lady Bertram is formed for the enjoyment
of all her readers; and a pale example of what she
might have become under less propitious circumstances
is given by Mrs. Price. Mrs. Norris, we are
told, would have done much better than Mrs. Price
in her position. It must have given Jane Austen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
great pleasure to make this remark. None of her
bad characters (except possibly Elizabeth Elliot)
were quite inhuman to her, and to have found a
situation in which Mrs. Norris might have shone
would be a real satisfaction.</p>

<p>One more remark may be made on <i>Mansfield
Park</i>. It affords what perhaps is the only<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> probable
instance in these books of a portrait drawn from life.
She must, one would think, have had in her mind her
brother Charles&mdash;as he had been twelve or fourteen
years earlier&mdash;when she drew so charming a sketch
of a young sailor in William Price.</p>

<p>We must not forget, however, the author's strong
denial of depicting individuals, and her declaration
that she was too proud of her gentlemen 'to admit
that they were only Mr. A. or Colonel B.'; nor yet
her modest confession, when speaking of two of her
favourites&mdash;Edmund Bertram and Mr. Knightley&mdash;that
she was aware they were 'very far from what I
know English gentlemen often are.'</p>

<p>Jane Austen may perhaps enjoy the distinction
of having added words or expressions to colloquial
English. The name 'Collins' is almost established
as the description of a letter of thanks after a visit;
and we have heard of a highly intelligent family
among whom a guinea is always alluded to as 'something
considerable' in memory of the sum believed
(on the authority of the <i>Memoir</i>) to have been given
to William Price by Aunt Norris.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3><i>EMMA</i></h3>

<h3>1814-1815</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>The</span> last letter but one of the foregoing chapter
contains two sentences mentioning the writer's
brother, Mr. Knight, which will help us to carry
on our story.</div>

<p>Writing on March 5, 1814, Jane says: 'It is a
nasty day for everybody. Edward's spirits will be
wanting sunshine, and here is nothing but thickness
and sleet'; and towards the conclusion of the same
letter we find the following: 'Perhaps you have not
heard that Edward has a good chance of escaping
his lawsuit. His opponent "knocks under." The
terms of agreement are not quite settled.'</p>

<p>There can, we think, be little doubt that both
passages&mdash;the depressed and the hopeful&mdash;refer to
a claim over Edward's Hampshire property made by
some of the heirs-at-law of the former Knight family
whom the Brodnaxes of Godmersham had succeeded.
Unfortunately, the cheerful forecast contained in
the second passage did not prove to be in accordance
with the facts. The lawsuit hung on for three
years and was then compromised by Mr. Knight's
paying a large sum of money.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the claim also had its influence in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
producing the one unflattering estimate of Jane
which we shall have to lay before the reader.</p>

<p>Miss Mitford was a convinced&mdash;but apparently a
reluctant&mdash;admirer of her genius; and she dwells without
disguise on what she considers the want of taste
in <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, though even here she adds
that Miss Austen 'wants nothing but the <i>beau id&eacute;al</i> of
the female character to be a perfect novel writer.'</p>

<p>In another letter she refers to her mother's
unfavourable reminiscences of Jane Austen as a
husband-hunter; although Mrs. Mitford's remark
must (as we have already pointed out<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>) have been
based on an entire misrepresentation, owing to Jane's
youthful age at the time when that lady could have
known her.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>She proceeds thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A friend of mine who visits her now, says that
she has stiffened into the most perpendicular, precise,
taciturn piece of 'single blessedness' that ever
existed, and that, till <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> showed
what a precious gem was hidden in that unbending
case, she was no more regarded in society than a
poker or a fire-screen, or any other thin, upright
piece of wood or iron that fills the corner in peace
and quietness. The case is very different now: she
is still a poker&mdash;but a poker of whom every one is
afraid. It must be confessed that this silent observation
from such an observer is rather formidable.
Most writers are good-humoured chatterers&mdash;neither
very wise nor very witty; but nine times out of
ten (at least in the few that I have known) unaffected
and pleasant, and quite removing by their conversation
any fear that may have been excited by their
works. But a wit, a delineator of character, who
does not talk, is terrific indeed!</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>
<p>Miss Mitford has, however, the candour to add a
qualification which diminishes the force of her earlier
remarks, and bears upon our present subject. She
says:&mdash;</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>After all, I do not know that I can quite
vouch for this account, though the friend from whom
I received it is truth itself; but her family connexions
must render her disagreeable to Miss Austen,
since she is the sister-in-law of a gentleman who is
at law with Miss A.'s brother for the greater part of
his fortune. You must have remarked how much
her stories hinge upon entailed estates&mdash;doubtless she
has learnt to dislike entails. Her brother was adopted
by a Mr. Knight, who left him his name and two
much better legacies in an estate of five thousand a
year in Kent, and another of nearly double the value
in Hampshire; but it seems he forgot some ceremony&mdash;passing
a fine, I think they call it&mdash;with regard to
the Hampshire property, which Mr. Baverstock has
claimed in right of his mother, together with the
mesne rents, and is likely to be successful.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p></div>

<p>Miss Mitford, indeed, could hardly have done less,
after repeating this somewhat spiteful gossip, than
mention the hostile quarter from which it arose.
We have considered it right to quote part of it, as
the writer is an author of some note: but we venture
to think that those readers who have accompanied
us so far will believe that Jane was guilty of nothing
worse than being shy, and talking but little among
strangers; and that such strangers as knew something
of her literary ability believed, but were quite wrong<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
in believing, that she was taking stock of their
peculiarities with a view to introducing them into
her next novel.</p>

<p>Jane had now completed the first of three visits
which she was to pay to Henry this year, and
Cassandra was in London in her place; while the
Godmersham party were spending two months at
Chawton. The two following letters were written
by Jane from Chawton in anticipation of a visit to
the Cookes at Bookham. Incidentally, Mr. Cooke's
remark (quoted in the first) shows that <i>Mansfield
Park</i> was already published. We must not forget,
however, that its author had been, since January
1814, deep in the composition of <i>Emma</i>, and she
would be sure to use a visit to the neighbourhood
of Leatherhead and Box Hill to verify geographical
and other details for her new work. Since her fame
was fully established, there have been many attempts
to identify the locality of Highbury. 'There is a
school of serious students who place it at Esher;
another band of enthusiasts support Dorking'; but
Mr. E. V. Lucas, in his introduction to a recent edition
of the novel, prefers the claim of Leatherhead, which,
he says, is rightly placed as regards London and
Kingston, and not far wrong as regards Box Hill.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>
Near Leatherhead is a house called 'Randalls';
and in 1761 the vestry of the parish paid their thanks
'in the most respectful manner to Mr. Knightley,'
who had remodelled the pulpit and reading-desk of
the church.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>Cobham should be mentioned as another possible
alternative, as the distances from London, Richmond,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
Kingston, and Box Hill suit well.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> But the most
probable supposition of all is that the author purposely
avoided identifying it with any one village,
while sufficiently defining its position in the county
of Surrey.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dearest Cassandra</span>,&mdash;Fanny takes my
mother to Alton this morning, which gives me an
opportunity of sending you a few lines without any
other trouble than that of writing them.</p>

<p>This is a delightful day in the country, and I
hope not much too hot for town. Well, you had
a good journey, I trust, and all that, and not rain
enough to spoil your bonnet. It appeared so likely
to be a wet evening that I went up to the Gt. House
between three and four, and dawdled away an hour
very comfortably, though Edwd. was not very brisk.
The air was clearer in the evening and he was better.
We all five walked together into the kitchen garden
and along the Gosport road, and they drank tea
with us.</p>

<p>The only letter to-day is from Mrs. Cooke to me.
They do not leave home till July, and want me to
come to them, according to my promise. And, after
considering everything, I have resolved on going.</p>

<p>In addition to their standing claims on me they
admire <i>Mansfield Park</i> exceedingly. Mr. Cooke says
'it is the most sensible novel he ever read,' and
the manner in which I treat the clergy delights them
very much. Altogether, I must go, and I want you
to join me there when your visit in Henrietta St.

to death in running after the Emperor.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> The report
in Alton yesterday was that they would certainly
travel this road either to or from Portsmouth. I long
to know what this bow of the Prince's will produce.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Thursday [June 23].
</div>

<p>I heard yesterday from Frank. When he began
his letter he hoped to be here on Monday, but before
it was ended he had been told that the naval review
would not take place till Friday, which would probably
occasion him some delay, as he cannot get some
necessary business of his own attended to while
Portsmouth is in such a bustle. I hope Fanny has
seen the Emperor, and then I may fairly wish them
all away. I go to-morrow, and hope for some delays
and adventures.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Henry at White's! Oh, what a Henry! I do
not know what to wish as to Miss B., so I will hold
my tongue and my wishes.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>We have called upon Miss Dusantoy and Miss
Papillon, and been very pretty. Miss D. has a great
idea of being Fanny Price&mdash;she and her youngest
sister together, who is named Fanny.</p>

<div class='right'><span style="margin-right: 2em;">Yours very affectionately,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">J. Austen.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Jane's visit to Bookham began on June 24, as
soon as the Knights had left Chawton. She was to
be away for more than a fortnight, and must have
been at Chawton again for a month till the middle of
August, when she once more went to join Henry in
London. On this occasion she had no rich brother to
take her in his carriage, and was forced to come by
Yalden's somewhat crowded coach&mdash;four inside and
fifteen on the top. Henry had moved between June
and August, finding a house in his old neighbourhood
at 23 Hans Place. Next to him (but separated from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
him by the entrance to the Pavilion, now the road
leading to Pont Street), at No. 22, was the St.
Quentins' celebrated school, at which Miss Mitford
had been a pupil, as well as Miss Landon and
Lady Caroline Lamb.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> Three doors off, at No. 26,
lived Henry's partner, Mr. Tilson, with whom it was
possible to converse across the intermediate gardens.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'><br />23 Hans Place: Tuesday morning [August, 1814].
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Cassandra</span>,&mdash;I had a very good journey,
not crowded, two of the three taken up at Bentley
being children, the others of a reasonable size; and
they were all very quiet and civil. We were late in
London, from being a great load, and from changing
coaches at Farnham; it was nearly four, I believe,
when we reached Sloane Street. Henry himself met
me, and as soon as my trunk and basket could be
routed out from all the other trunks and baskets
in the world, we were on our way to Hans Place in
the luxury of a nice, large, cool, dirty hackney coach.</p>

<p>There were four in the kitchen part of Yalden,
and I was told fifteen at top, among them Percy Benn.
We met in the same room at Egham, but poor Percy
was not in his usual spirits. He would be more chatty,
I dare say, in his way <i>from</i> Woolwich. We took up a
young Gibson at Holybourn, and, in short, everybody
either <i>did</i> come up by Yalden yesterday, or wanted
to come up. It put me in mind of my own coach
between Edinburgh and Stirling.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It is a delightful place&mdash;more than answers my
expectation. Having got rid of my unreasonable
ideas, I find more space and comfort in the rooms
than I had supposed, and the garden is quite a love.
I am in the front attic, which is the bedchamber to
be preferred.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p><hr style='width: 45%;' />

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;I got the willow yesterday, as Henry
was not quite ready when I reached Hen<sup>a.</sup> St. I saw
Mr. Hampson there for a moment. He dines here
to-morrow and proposed bringing his son; so I must
submit to seeing George Hampson, though I had
hoped to go through life without it. It was one of
my vanities, like your not reading <i>Patronage</i>.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Is not this all that can have happened or been
arranged? Not quite. Henry wants me to see more
of his Hanwell favourite, and has written to invite
her to spend a day or two here with me. His
scheme is to fetch her on Saturday. I am more and
more convinced that he will marry again soon, and
like the idea of <i>her</i> better than of anybody else,
at hand.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Yours very truly and affectionately,</span><br />

<p><small>Miss Austen, Chawton.</small><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><small>By favour of Mr. Gray.</small></span>
</p></div>

<p>All through this year and the early part of the
next, <i>Emma</i> (begun January 1814, finished March 29,
1815) was assiduously worked at. Although polished to
the highest degree, it was more quickly composed than
any previous work and gave evidence of a practised
hand. It was also the most 'Austenish' of all her
novels, carrying out most completely her idea of what
was fitted to her tastes and capacities. She enjoyed
having a heroine 'whom no one would like but herself,'
and working on 'three or four families in a country
village.' <i>Emma</i> appeals therefore more exclusively
than any of the others to an inner circle of admirers:
but such admirers may possibly place it at the head
of her compositions. There are no stirring incidents;
there is no change of scene. The heroine, whose
society we enjoy throughout, never sleeps away from
home, and even there sees only so much company as
an invalid father can welcome. No character in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
book is ill, no one is ruined, there is no villain, and
no paragon. On the other hand, the plot is admirably
contrived and never halts; while the mysteries&mdash;exclusively
mysteries of courtship and love&mdash;are
excellently maintained. Emma never expresses any
opinion which is thoroughly sound, and seldom makes
any forecast which is not belied by the event, yet we
always recognise her acuteness, and she by degrees
obtains our sympathy. The book also illustrates to
the highest degree the author's power of drawing
humorous characters; Miss Bates, Mr. Woodhouse,
and Mrs. Elton in the first class, and Harriet Smith in
the second. And the humour is always essential to the
delineation of character&mdash;it is never an excrescence.
It also depends more on what is said than on any
tricks of speech; there are no catch-words, and
every one speaks practically the same excellent
English. Besides this, <i>Emma</i> also gives a very good
instance of the author's habit of building up her
characters almost entirely without formal description,
and leaving analysis to her readers.</p>

<p>Her custom of following her creations outside the
printed pages enables us to say that the word swept
aside unread by Jane Fairfax was 'pardon'; and
that the Knightleys' exclusion from Donwell was
ended by the death of Mr. Woodhouse in two years'
time. According to a less well-known tradition,
Jane Fairfax survived her elevation only nine or ten
years. Whether the John Knightleys afterwards settled
at Hartfield, and whether Frank Churchill married
again, may be legitimate subjects for speculation.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, <i>Mansfield Park</i> was selling well, and
the idea of a second edition began to be mooted.
Writing from Chawton to her niece Fanny on another
subject (November 18, 1814), she tells her that the
first edition is all sold, and adds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Your Uncle Henry is rather wanting me to
come to town to settle about a second edition,
but as I could not very conveniently leave home
now, I have written him my will and pleasure,
and, unless he still urges it, shall not go. I am very
greedy, and want to make the most of it, but as you
are much above caring about money I shall not
plague you with any particulars. The pleasures of
vanity are more within your comprehension, and you
will enter into mine at receiving the <i>praise</i> which
every now and then comes to me through some
channel or other.</p></div>

<p>She did, however, leave home; and our next
extract is from a letter written to Fanny from 23 Hans
Place, and dated November 30:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Thank you, but it is not yet settled whether I
<i>do</i> hazard a second edition. We are to see Egerton
to-day, when it will probably be determined. People
are more ready to borrow and praise than to buy, which
I cannot wonder at; but though I like praise as well
as anybody, I like what Edward calls 'Pewter' too.</p></div>

<p>Apparently, Egerton did not fancy taking the
risk; for there was no second edition until 1816, when
it appeared from the publishing house of Murray.</p>

<p>Jane's stay in London was a short one; but it
included a visit to her niece Anna, who had lately
been married to Ben Lefroy, and who was living
for the time at Hendon. Early in December, Jane
returned home; and three weeks later she and
Cassandra set out for a couple of visits: one for a
week to Mrs. Heathcote and Miss Bigg in Winchester;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
the other of longer duration, to their brother at
Steventon. Then the curtain is rung down once
more, not to be raised till the end of September 1815.
During this quiet time, <i>Emma</i> was prepared for the
press, and it was no doubt in connexion with its
publication that she went to Hans Place on October 4,
1815, for a visit which proved to be much longer and
more eventful than the last. For some reason that
we are unable to explain, Jane now forsook her
former publisher, Mr. Egerton, and put her interests
in the charge of the historic house of Murray. She
travelled up once more in the company of Henry, who
had been paying his mother and sisters a short visit
at the cottage. The prolongation of Jane's stay in
London to more than a couple of months was caused
by Henry's dangerous illness. She gives the news
in a letter written to Cassandra and dated Tuesday,
October 17:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What weather we have! What shall we
do about it? The 17th October and summer still!
Henry is not quite well&mdash;a bilious attack with fever.
He came back early from Henrietta Street yesterday
and went to bed&mdash;the comical consequence of which
was that Mr. Seymour and I dined together <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>.
He is calomeling, and therefore in a way to be better,
and I hope may be well to-morrow.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Henry's illness is much more serious
than I expected. He has been in bed since three
o'clock on Monday. It is a fever&mdash;something bilious
but chiefly inflammatory. I am not alarmed, but
I have determined to send this letter to-day by the
post, that you may know how things are going on.
There is no chance of his being able to leave Town on
Saturday. I asked Mr. Haden<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> that question to-day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
Mr. H. is the apothecary from the corner of Sloane
Street, successor to Mr. Smith, a very young man, said
to be clever, and he is certainly very attentive, and
appears hitherto to have understood the complaint.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>As for myself, you may be sure I shall return as
soon as I can. Tuesday is in my brain, but you will
feel the uncertainty of it.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>You must fancy Henry in the backroom upstairs,
and I am generally there also, working or writing.</p></div>

<p>Even in illness, the interests of <i>Emma</i> were not
neglected; and a day or two later Henry was able
to dictate the following letter to Mr. Murray:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Severe illness has confined me to
my bed ever since I received yours of y<sup>e</sup> 15th. I
cannot yet hold a pen, and employ an amanuensis.
The politeness and perspicuity of your letter equally
claim my earliest exertion. Your official opinion of
the merits of <i>Emma</i> is very valuable and satisfactory.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>
Though I venture to differ occasionally
from your critique, yet I assure you the quantum of
your commendation rather exceeds than falls short
of the author's expectation and my own. The
terms you offer are so very inferior to what we had
expected that I am apprehensive of having made some
great error in my arithmetical calculation. On the
subject of the expence and profit of publishing
you must be much better informed than I am, but
documents in my possession appear to prove that
the sum offered by you for the copyright of <i>Sense
and Sensibility</i>, <i>Mansfield Park</i>, and <i>Emma</i> is not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
equal to the money which my sister has actually
cleared by one very moderate edition of <i>Mansfield
Park;</i>&mdash;(you yourself expressed astonishment that
so small an edition of such a work should have been
sent into the world)&mdash;and a still smaller one of <i>Sense
and Sensibility</i>.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p></div>

<p>Henry, however, became so alarmingly ill that on
October 22 Jane dispatched expresses to her brothers
and sister, summoning them to London. Mr.
Knight left Godmersham for town on the 23rd, but
owing to a delay in the delivery of the letter, James
Austen did not receive his till the 24th. He rode
to Chawton that evening, and the next day he
and Cassandra arrived in London. For a time
Henry's life was in imminent danger, but after a
week's anxiety he was so far on the road to recovery
that his two brothers were able to return
home, leaving Jane and Cassandra in charge.</p>

<p>It was owing to Jane's untiring exertions at this
time that her health began to suffer. One other
consequence too, but of a less tragical kind, was due
to Henry's illness. The physician that attended
him&mdash;supplementing, no doubt, Mr. Haden&mdash;was one
of the Prince Regent's physicians, and he, either
knowing or hearing (for it was now an open secret)
that Jane Austen was the author of <i>Pride and
Prejudice</i>, informed her that the Prince greatly
admired her novels, 'that he read them often, and
kept a set in every one of his residences; that he
himself had thought it right to inform His Royal
Highness that Miss Austen was staying in London.'
The Prince did not so far condescend as to desire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
to see Miss Austen in person, but he instructed his
librarian, Mr. Clarke, to wait upon her and show her
any civility in his power. The result was that on
November 13 Jane was shown over the library and
other apartments at Carlton House, and in the course
of the visit Mr. Clarke announced that if Miss Austen
had any other novel forthcoming, she was at liberty
to dedicate it to the Prince. We cannot tell what
may have been the exact amount of pleasure given
to Jane by this piece of information, as Cassandra
was at that time also in Hans Place, and there is
therefore no letter of Jane to her on the subject.
But, at any rate, Jane was loyal enough to wish to
do what was right and proper in the circumstances.
Consequently, on November 15, we find her writing
to Mr. Clarke as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I must take the liberty of asking you a
question. Among the many flattering attentions
which I received from you at Carlton House on
Monday last, was the information of my being at
liberty to dedicate any future work to His Royal
Highness, the Prince Regent, without the necessity
of any solicitation on my part. Such, at least, I
believed to be your words; but as I am very anxious
to be quite certain of what was intended, I entreat
you to have the goodness to inform me how such a
permission is to be understood, and whether it is
incumbent on me to show my sense of the honour
by inscribing the work now in the press to His Royal
Highness; I should be equally concerned to appear
either presumptuous or ungrateful.</p></div>

<p>To which Mr. Clarke replied:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'><br />Carlton House: November 16, 1815.
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,&mdash;It is certainly not <i>incumbent</i> on
you to dedicate your work now in the press to His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
Royal Highness; but if you wish to do the Regent
that honour either now or at any future period, I am
happy to send you that permission, which need not
require any more trouble or solicitation on your part.</p>

<p>Your late works, Madam, and in particular
<i>Mansfield Park</i>, reflect the highest honour on your
genius and your principles. In every new work your
mind seems to increase its energy and power of
discrimination. The Regent has read and admired
all your publications.</p>

<p>Accept my sincere thanks for the pleasure your
volumes have given me: in the perusal of them I
felt a great inclination to write and say so. And I
also, dear Madam, wished to be allowed to ask you
to delineate in some future work the habits of life,
and character, and enthusiasm of a clergyman, who
should pass his time between the metropolis and
the country, who should be something like Beattie's
Minstrel:&mdash;</p>



<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="Beattie's Minstrel">

<tr><td align='left'><span style="margin-left: 2em;">And now his look was most demurely sad;</span></td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>And now he laughed aloud, yet none knew why.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Neither Goldsmith, nor La Fontaine in his <i>Tableau
de Famille</i>, have in my mind quite delineated an
English clergyman, at least of the present day, fond
of and entirely engaged in literature, no man's enemy
but his own. Pray, dear Madam, think of these
things.</p>
<p>Believe me at all times with sincerity and respect,</p>
<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Your faithful and obliged servant,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">J. S. Clarke</span>, <i>Librarian</i>.
</div>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I am going for about three weeks to
Mr. Henry Streatfeild, Chiddingstone, Sevenoaks,
but hope on my return to town to have the honour
of seeing you again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>
</div>
<p>On November 17 Henry was sufficiently recovered
to address a letter to Mr. John Murray on his sister's
behalf. This was followed by a letter from herself
on November 23.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'><br />Hans Place: Thursday [November 23, 1815].
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;My brother's note last Monday has been so
fruitless, that I am afraid there can be but little
chance of my writing to any good effect; but yet I
am so very much disappointed and vexed by the
delays of the printers, that I cannot help begging to
know whether there is no hope of their being quickened.
Instead of the work being ready by the end
of the present month, it will hardly, at the rate we
now proceed, be finished by the end of the next; and
as I expect to leave London early in December, it is
of consequence that no more time should be lost.
Is it likely that the printers will be influenced to
greater dispatch and punctuality by knowing that
the work is to be dedicated, by permission, to the
Prince Regent? If you can make that circumstance
operate, I shall be very glad. My brother returns
<i>Waterloo</i><a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> with many thanks for the loan of it.
We have heard much of Scott's account of Paris.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>
If it be not incompatible with other arrangements,
would you favour us with it, supposing you have
any set already opened? You may depend upon
its being in careful hands.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">I remain, Sir, your ob<sup>t.</sup> humble Se<sup>t.,</sup></span><br />
<span class="smcap">J. Austen.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Meanwhile, as Henry was mending, his brother
Edward, who had brought his daughter Fanny up to
town, left her as a companion to her Aunt Jane, and
escorted Cassandra to Chawton.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<div class='blockquot'><div class='right'><br />Hans Place: Friday [November 24, 1815].
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dearest Cassandra</span>,&mdash;I have the pleasure
of sending you a much better account of <i>my affairs</i>,
which I know will be a great delight to you.</p>

<p>I wrote to Mr. Murray yesterday myself, and
Henry wrote at the same time to Roworth.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> Before
the notes were out of the house, I received three sheets
and an apology from R. We sent the notes, however,
and I had a most civil one in reply from Mr. M.
He is so very polite, indeed, that it is quite overcoming.
The printers have been waiting for paper&mdash;the
blame is thrown upon the stationer; but he
gives his word that I shall have no farther cause
for dissatisfaction. He has lent us <i>Miss Williams</i><a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>
and <i>Scott</i>, and says that any book of his will
always be at <i>my</i> service. In short, I am soothed
and complimented into tolerable comfort.</p>

<p>To-morrow Mr. Haden is to dine with us. There
is happiness! We really grow so fond of Mr. Haden
that I do not know what to expect. He, and Mr.
Tilson, and Mr. Philips made up our circle of wits
last night; Fanny played, and he sat and listened
and suggested improvements, till Richard came in
to tell him that 'the doctor was waiting for him at
Captn. Blake's'; and then he was off with a speed
that you can imagine. He never does appear in the
least above his profession, or out of humour with it,
or I should think poor Captn. Blake, whoever he is,
in a very bad way.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Yours very affectionately,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">J. Austen.</span><br />
</div>

<p>I have been listening to dreadful insanity. It
is Mr. Haden's firm belief that a person <i>not</i> musical
is fit for every sort of wickedness. I ventured to
assert a little on the other side, but wished the cause
in abler hands.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>
<div class='right'><br />Hans Place: Sunday [November 26, 1815].
</div>

<p>I <i>did</i> mention the P. R. in my note to Mr. Murray;
it brought me a fine compliment in return. Whether
it has done any other good I do not know, but Henry
thought it worth trying.</p>

<p>The printers continue to supply me very well.
I am advanced in Vol. III. to my <i>arra</i>-root, upon
which peculiar style of spelling there is a modest
query in the margin. I will not forget Anna's arrowroot.
I hope you have told Martha of my first
resolution of letting nobody know that I <i>might</i>
dedicate, &amp;c., for fear of being obliged to do it,
and that she is thoroughly convinced of my being
influenced now by nothing but the most mercenary
motives.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Then came dinner and Mr. Haden, who brought
good manners and clever conversation. From 7 to 8
the harp; at 8 Mrs. L. and Miss E. arrived, and for
the rest of the evening the drawing-room was thus
arranged: on the sofa side the two ladies, Henry, and
myself, making the best of it; on the opposite side
Fanny and Mr. Haden, in two chairs (I <i>believe</i>, at
least, they had <i>two</i> chairs), talking together
uninterruptedly. Fancy the scene! And what is to
be fancied next? Why, that Mr. H. dines here again
to-morrow. To-day we are to have Mr. Barlow.
Mr. H. is reading <i>Mansfield Park</i> for the first time,
and prefers it to <i>P. and P.</i></p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Fanny has heard all that I have said to you
about herself and Mr. H. Thank you very much for
the sight of dearest Charles's letter to yourself. How
pleasantly and how naturally he writes! and how
perfect a picture of his disposition and feelings his
style conveys! Poor dear fellow! Not a present!
I have a great mind to send him all the twelve copies
which were to have been dispersed among my near<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
connections, beginning with the P. R. and ending
with Countess Morley. Adieu.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Yours affectionately,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">J. Austen.</span>
Miss Austen.
</div>


<div class='right'><br />Saturday [December 2, 1815].
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Cassandra</span>,&mdash;Henry came back yesterday,
and might have returned the day before if he
had known as much in time.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I had the comfort of a few lines on Wednesday
morning from Henry himself, just after your letter
was gone, giving so good an account of his feelings
as made me perfectly easy. He met with the utmost
care and attention at Hanwell, spent his two days
there very quietly and pleasantly, and, being certainly
in no respect the worse for going, we may
believe that he must be better, as he is quite sure of
being himself. To make his return a complete gala
Mr. Haden was secured for dinner. I need not say
that our evening was agreeable.</p>

<p>But you seem to be under a mistake as to Mr. H.
You call him an apothecary. He is no apothecary;
he has never been an apothecary; there is not an
apothecary in this neighbourhood&mdash;the only inconvenience
of the situation perhaps&mdash;but so it is; we
have not a medical man within reach. He is a Haden,
nothing but a Haden, a sort of wonderful nondescript
creature on two legs, something between a man and
an angel, but without the least spice of an apothecary.
He is, perhaps, the only person <i>not</i> an apothecary
hereabouts. He has never sung to us. He will not
sing without a pianoforte accompaniment.</p>

<p>I am sorry my mother has been suffering, and
am afraid this exquisite weather is too good to agree
with her. <i>I</i> enjoy it all over me, from top to toe,
from right to left, longitudinally, perpendicularly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
diagonally; and I cannot but selfishly hope we are
to have it last till Christmas&mdash;nice, unwholesome,
unseasonable, relaxing, close, muggy weather.</p>

<div class='right'><span style="margin-right: 2em;">Yours affectionately,</span><br />

<p>It strikes me that I have no business to give the
P. R. a binding, but we will take counsel upon the
question.</p></div>


<p>Two more letters were written by the author to
her publisher while the work was in his hands.</p>

<p>On December 11, she writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>As I find that <i>Emma</i> is advertised for publication
as early as Saturday next, I think it best to lose
no time in settling all that remains to be settled on
the subject, and adopt this method as involving the
smallest tax on your time.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The title-page must be '<i>Emma</i>, dedicated
by permission to H.R.H. the Prince Regent.' And
it is my particular wish that one set should be completed
and sent to H.R.H. two or three days before
the work is generally public. It should be sent
under cover to the Rev. J. S. Clarke, Librarian,
Carlton House. I shall subjoin a list of those persons
to whom I must trouble you to forward also a set
each, when the work is out; all unbound with
'From the Authoress' on the first page.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I return also <i>Mansfield Park</i> as ready
for a second edition, I believe, as I can make it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>
I am in Hans Place till the 16th; from that day
inclusive, my direction will be Chawton, Alton,
Hants.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p></div>

<p>On receipt of this, Mr. Murray seems to have sent
round a note immediately, asking if it really was
Miss Austen's wish that the dedication should be
placed on the title-page, for we find Jane writing
again the same day:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am very much obliged by yours,
and very happy to feel everything arranged to our
mutual satisfaction. As to my direction about the
title-page, it was arising from my ignorance only,
and from my having never noticed the proper place
for a dedication. I thank you for putting me right.
Any deviation from what is usually done in such cases
is the last thing I should wish for. I feel happy in
having a friend to save me from the ill effect of my
own blunder.</p></div>

<p>On December 11, Jane resumed her correspondence
with Mr. Clarke:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;My <i>Emma</i> is now so near publication
that I feel it right to assure you of my not having
forgotten your kind recommendation of an early
copy for Carlton House, and that I have Mr. Murray's
promise of its being sent to His Royal Highness, under
cover to you, three days previous to the work being
really out. I must make use of this opportunity to
thank you, dear Sir, for the very high praise you
bestow on my other novels. I am too vain to wish
to convince you that you have praised them beyond
their merit. My greatest anxiety at present is that
this fourth work should not disgrace what was good
in the others. But on this point I will do myself the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
justice to declare that, whatever may be my wishes
for its success, I am very strongly haunted by the
idea that to those readers who have preferred <i>Pride
and Prejudice</i> it will appear inferior in wit; and to
those who have preferred <i>Mansfield Park</i>, very
inferior in good sense. Such as it is, however, I
hope you will do me the favour of accepting a copy.
Mr. Murray will have directions for sending one.
I am quite honoured by your thinking me capable of
drawing such a clergyman as you gave the sketch
of in your note of November 16th. But I assure you
I am <i>not</i>. The comic part of the character I might
be equal to, but not the good, the enthusiastic, the
literary. Such a man's conversation must at times
be on subjects of science and philosophy, of which I
know nothing; or at least occasionally abundant in
quotations and allusions which a woman who, like
me, knows only her own mother tongue, and has
read little in that, would be totally without the power
of giving. A classical education, or at any rate a
very extensive acquaintance with English literature,
ancient and modern, appears to me quite indispensable
for the person who would do any justice to your
clergyman; and I think I may boast myself to be,
with all possible vanity, the most unlearned and
uninformed female who ever dared to be an authoress.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">Believe me, dear Sir,</span>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Your obliged and faithful hum<sup>bl</sup> Ser<sup>t.,</sup></span>
<span class="smcap">Jane Austen.</span>
</div></div>

<p>But Mr. Clarke had not finished with his suggestions,
for he replied in a few days:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'><br />Carlton House: Thursday [December 1815].
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Madam</span>,&mdash;The letter you were so obliging
as to do me the honour of sending, was forwarded to
me in Kent, where, in a village, Chiddingstone, near
Sevenoaks, I had been hiding myself from all bustle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
and turmoil and getting spirits for a winter campaign,
and strength to stand the sharp knives which many
a Shylock is wetting [<i>sic</i>] to cut more than a pound
of flesh from my heart, on the appearance of <i>James
the Second</i>.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p>On Monday I go to Lord Egremont's at Petworth&mdash;where
your praises have long been sounded as they
ought to be&mdash;I shall then look in on the party at the
Pavilion<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> for a couple of nights, and return to preach
at Park Street Chapel, Green Street, on the Thanksgiving
Day.</p>

<p>You were very good to send me <i>Emma</i>, which
I have in no respect deserved. It is gone to the
Prince Regent. I have read only a few pages, which
I very much admired&mdash;there is so much nature and
excellent description of character in everything you
describe. Pray continue to write and make all your
friends send sketches to help you&mdash;and <i>M&eacute;moires
pour servir</i>, as the French term it. Do let us have
an English clergyman after your fancy&mdash;much novelty
may be introduced&mdash;show, dear Madam, what good
would be done if tythes were taken away entirely,
and describe him burying his own mother, as I did,
because the High Priest of the Parish in which she
died did not pay her remains the respect he ought
to do. I have never recovered the shock. Carry
your clergyman to sea as the friend of some distinguished
naval character about a Court, you can
then bring forward, like Le Sage, many interesting
scenes of character and interest.</p>

<p>But forgive me, I cannot write to you without
wishing to elicit your genius, and I fear I cannot do that
without trespassing on your patience and good nature.</p>

<p>I have desired Mr. Murray to procure, if he can,
two little works I ventured to publish from being
at sea&mdash;sermons which I wrote and preached on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
ocean, and the edition which I published of Falconer's
<i>Shipwreck</i>.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>Pray, dear Madam, remember that beside my cell
at Carlton House, I have another which Dr. Barne
procured for me at No. 37 Golden Square, where I
often hide myself. There is a small library there
much at your service, and if you can make the cell
render you any service as a sort of halfway house
when you come to Town, I shall be most happy.
There is a maid servant of mine always there.</p>

<p>I hope to have the honour of sending you <i>James
the Second</i> when it reaches a second edition, as some
few notes may possibly be then added.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Yours, dear Madam, very sincerely,</span><br />
J. S. <span class="smcap">Clarke</span>.
</div></div>

<p>It is evident that what the writer of the above
letter chiefly desired, was that Jane Austen should
depict a clergyman who should resemble no one so
much as the Rev. J. S. Clarke. This is borne
out again in a further letter in which Mr. Clarke
expressed the somewhat tardy thanks of his Royal
master.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'><br />Pavilion: March 27, 1816.
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Miss Austen</span>,&mdash;I have to return you the
thanks of His Royal Highness, the Prince Regent, for
the handsome copy you sent him of your last excellent
novel. Pray, dear Madam, soon write again and
again. Lord St. Helens and many of the nobility,
who have been staying here, paid you the just
tribute of their praise.</p>

<p>The Prince Regent has just left us for London;
and having been pleased to appoint me Chaplain and
Private English Secretary to the Prince of Cobourg,
I remain here with His Serene Highness and a select
party until the marriage. Perhaps when you again<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
appear in print you may chuse to dedicate your
volumes to Prince Leopold: any historical romance,
illustrative of the history of the august House of
Cobourg, would just now be very interesting.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 6em;">Believe me at all times,</span><br />
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">Dear Miss Austen,</span><br />
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Your obliged friend,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">J. S. Clarke.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Jane's sensible reply put an end to any further
suggestions:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am honoured by the Prince's
thanks and very much obliged to yourself for the
kind manner in which you mention the work. I
have also to acknowledge a former letter forwarded
to me from Hans Place. I assure you I felt very
grateful for the friendly tenor of it, and hope my
silence will have been considered, as it was truly
meant, to proceed only from an unwillingness to tax
your time with idle thanks. Under every interesting
circumstance which your own talent and literary
labours have placed you in, or the favour of the
Regent bestowed, you have my best wishes. Your
recent appointments I hope are a step to something
still better. In my opinion, the service of a court
can hardly be too well paid, for immense must be the
sacrifice of time and feeling required by it.</p>

<p>You are very, very kind in your hints as to the
sort of composition which might recommend me at
present, and I am fully sensible that an historical
romance, founded on the House of Saxe Cobourg,
might be much more to the purpose of profit or popularity
than such pictures of domestic life in country
villages as I deal in. But I could no more write a
romance than an epic poem. I could not sit seriously
down to write a serious romance under any other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
motive than to save my life; and if it were indispensable
for me to keep it up and never relax into
laughing at myself or at other people, I am sure I
should be hung before I had finished the first chapter.
No, I must keep to my own style and go on in my
own way, and though I may never succeed again
in that, I am convinced that I should totally fail in
any other.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">I remain, my dear Sir,</span><br />

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3><i>PERSUASION</i></h3>

<h3>1815-1816</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>So</span> far as we know, Jane went to London in 1815
perfectly sound in health. Her remark to Cassandra
on her enjoyment of the muggy, unwholesome
weather is written with the security of a person
accustomed to be free from bodily ailments, and
expecting that condition of things to continue. But,
alas! we must look upon this visit, which seemed
to mark the highest point in her modest fame, as
marking also a downward stage in her career as
regards both prosperity and health. Perhaps
the excitement of the publication of <i>Emma</i>, and
probably the close attention on the sick-bed of her
brother which coincided with it&mdash;possibly even the
muggy weather which she praised so highly&mdash;combined
to diminish her vigour, and to sow the seeds of
a disease, the exact nature of which no one seems
ever to have been able to determine. These, however,
were not the only disquieting circumstances
which surrounded her. In the following March her
favourite brother, Henry, was declared a bankrupt;
and there are one or two indications of her being
aware that all was not well with the firm in the autumn.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
The months which intervened while this catastrophe
was impending must have been very trying to one
already weakened by all that she had gone through.
More agreeable associations, however, arose from
the success of <i>Emma</i>. There was, for instance, a
pleasant exchange of letters with the Countess of
Morley, a lady of some literary capacity, to whom
Jane had sent a copy of <i>Emma</i>, and who expressed
her thanks and admiration in very warm terms.
The author in her turn, speaking of Lady Morley's
approval, says: 'It encourages me to depend on the
same share of general good opinion which <i>Emma's</i>
predecessors have experienced, and to believe that
I have not yet, as almost every writer of fancy does
sooner or later, overwritten myself.'</div>

<p>The end of March brought a still more flattering
tribute to Jane's growing fame, in the shape
of an article on <i>Emma</i> in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>.
The <i>Review</i>, though dated October 1815, did not
appear till March of the following year,<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> and the
writer of the article was none other than Sir Walter
Scott.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<p>The honour of an article in the <i>Quarterly</i> was
no doubt mainly due to the fact that Jane had
published her latest book with Mr. Murray, its
owner. Though the praise contained in the article
would scarcely satisfy an enthusiastic admirer of
her works,<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> Miss Austen felt she had no cause to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
complain. In thanking Mr. Murray for lending her
a copy of the <i>Review</i>, she writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The authoress of <i>Emma</i> has no reason, I think,
to complain of her treatment in it, except in
the total omission of <i>Mansfield Park</i>. I cannot but
be sorry that so clever a man as the Reviewer of
<i>Emma</i> should consider it as unworthy of being
noticed. You will be pleased to hear that I have
received the Prince's thanks for the <i>handsome</i> copy
I sent him of <i>Emma</i>. Whatever he may think of
<i>my</i> share of the work, yours seems to have been
quite right.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>The fact that she was honoured with a notice
in the <i>Quarterly</i> did not prevent the author from
collecting and leaving on record the more domestic
criticisms of her family and friends.</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">Opinions of</span> <i>Emma</i>.</div>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p><i>Captain F. Austen</i> liked it extremely, observing
that though there might be more wit in <i>P. and P.</i>
and an higher morality in <i>M. P.</i>, yet altogether, on
account of its peculiar air of Nature throughout, he
preferred it to either.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Frank Austen</i> liked and admired it very
much indeed, but must still prefer <i>P. and P.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. J. Bridges</i> preferred it to all the others.</p>

<p><i>Miss Sharp.</i>&mdash;Better than <i>M. P.</i>, but not so well
as <i>P. and P.</i> Pleased with the heroine for her
originality, delighted with Mr. K., and called Mrs.
Elton beyond praise&mdash;dissatisfied with Jane Fairfax.</p>

<p><i>Cassandra.</i>&mdash;Better than <i>P. and P.</i> but not so
well as <i>M. P.</i></p>

<p><i>Fanny K.</i>&mdash;Not so well as either <i>P. and P.</i> or
<i>M. P.</i> Could not bear Emma herself. Mr. Knightley
delightful. Should like J. F. if she knew more of her.</p>

<p><i>Mr. and Mrs. James Austen</i> did not like it so well
as either of the three others. Language different
from the others; not so easily read.</p>

<p><i>Edward</i> preferred it to <i>M. P.</i> only. Mr. K. liked
by everybody.</p>

<p><i>Miss Bigg.</i>&mdash;Not equal to either <i>P. and P.</i> or
<i>M. P.</i> Objected to the sameness of the subject
(Matchmaking) all through. Too much of Mrs.
Elton and H. Smith. Language superior to the
others.</p>

<p><i>My Mother</i> thought it more entertaining than
<i>M. P.</i>, but not so interesting as <i>P. and P.</i> No
characters in it equal to Lady Catherine or Mr.
Collins.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Miss Lloyd</i> thought it as clever as either of the
others, but did not receive so much pleasure from it
as from <i>P. and P.</i> and <i>M. P.</i></p>

<p><i>Fanny Cage</i> liked it very much indeed, and classed
it between <i>P. and P.</i> and <i>M. P.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. and Miss Craven</i> liked it very much, but not
so much as the others.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Sherer</i> did not think it equal to either <i>M. P.</i>
(which he liked the best of all) or <i>P. and P.</i> Displeased
with my pictures of clergymen.</p>

<p><i>Miss Bigg</i>, on reading it a second time, liked
Miss Bates much better than at first, and expressed
herself as liking all the people of Highbury in
general, except Harriet Smith, but could not help
still thinking <i>her</i> too silly in her loves.</p>

<p><i>The Family at Upton Gray</i> all very much amused
with it. Miss Bates a great favourite with Mrs.
Beaufoy.</p>

<p><i>Mr. and Mrs. Leigh Perrot</i> saw many beauties in
it, but could not think it equal to <i>P. and P.</i> Darcy
and Elizabeth had spoilt them for anything else.
Mr. K., however, an excellent character; Emma
better luck than a matchmaker often has; pitied
Jane Fairfax; thought Frank Churchill better
treated than he deserved.</p>

<p><i>Countess Craven</i> admired it very much, but did
not think it equal to <i>P. and P.</i> which she ranked as
the very first of its sort.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Guiton</i> thought it too natural to be interesting.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Digweed</i> did not like it so well as the others:
in fact if she had not known the author would hardly
have got through it.</p>

<p><i>Miss Terry</i> admired it very much, particularly
Mrs. Elton.</p>

<p><i>Henry Sanford</i>&mdash;very much pleased with it&mdash;delighted
with Miss Bates, but thought Mrs. Elton
the best-drawn character in the book. <i>Mansfield
Park</i>, however, still his favourite.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mr. Haden</i>&mdash;<i>quite</i> delighted with it. Admired the
character of Emma.</p>

<p><i>Miss Isabella Herries</i> did not like it. Objected
to my exposing the sex in the character of the heroine.
Convinced that I had meant Mrs. and Miss Bates
for some acquaintance of theirs. People whom I
never heard of before.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Harriet Moore</i> admired it very much, but
<i>M. P.</i> still her favourite of all.</p>

<p><i>Countess of Morley</i> delighted with it.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Cockerell</i> liked it so little that Fanny would
not send me his opinion.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Dickson</i> did not much like it&mdash;thought it
very inferior to <i>P. and P.</i> Liked it the less from
there being a Mr. and Mrs. Dixon in it.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Brandreth</i> thought the third volume superior
to anything I had ever written&mdash;quite beautiful!</p>

<p><i>Mr. B. Lefroy</i> thought that if there had been more
incident it would be equal to any of the others.
The characters quite as well-drawn and supported
as in any, and from being more every-day ones, the
more entertaining. Did not like the heroine so well
as any of the others. Miss Bates excellent, but rather
too much of her. Mr. and Mrs. Elton admirable and
John Knightley a sensible man.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. B. Lefroy</i> ranked <i>Emma</i> as a composition
with <i>S. and S.</i> Not so <i>brilliant</i> as <i>P. and P.</i> nor
so <i>equal</i> as <i>M. P.</i> Preferred Emma herself to all
the heroines. The characters, like all the others,
admirably well drawn and supported&mdash;perhaps rather
less strongly marked than some, but only the more
natural for that reason. Mr. Knightley, Mrs. Elton,
and Miss Bates her favourites. Thought one or two
of the conversations too long.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lefroy</i> preferred it to <i>M. P.</i>, but liked <i>M. P.</i>
the least of all.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Fowle</i> read only the first and last chapters,
because he had heard it was not interesting.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Lutley Sclater</i> liked it very much, better<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
than <i>M. P.</i>, and thought I had 'brought it all about
very cleverly in the last volume.'</p>

<p><i>Mrs. C. Cage</i> wrote thus to Fanny: 'A great
many thanks for the loan of <i>Emma</i>, which I am
delighted with. I like it better than any. Every
character is thoroughly kept up. I must enjoy
reading it again with Charles. Miss Bates is incomparable,
but I was nearly killed with those precious
treasures. They are unique, and really with more
fun than I can express. I am at Highbury all day,
and I can't help feeling I have just got into a new set
of acquaintance. No one writes such good sense,
and so very comfortable.'</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Wroughton</i> did not like it so well as <i>P. and P.</i>
Thought the authoress wrong, in such times as these,
to draw such clergymen as Mr. Collins and Mr. Elton.</p>

<p><i>Sir J. Langham</i> thought it much inferior to the
others.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Jeffrey</i> (of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>) was kept
up by it three nights.</p>

<p><i>Miss Murden.</i>&mdash;Certainly inferior to all the others.</p>

<p><i>Captain C. Austen</i> wrote: '<i>Emma</i> arrived in
time to a moment. I am delighted with her, more
so I think than even with my favourite, <i>Pride and
Prejudice</i>, and have read it three times in the passage.'</p>

<p><i>Mrs. D. Dundas</i> thought it very clever, but did
not like it so well as either of the others.</p></div>



<p>We do not know how Mr. Jeffrey's involuntary
tribute of admiration was conveyed to the author,
but we are sure she must have valued it very highly.
It was not the first time she had collected a miscellaneous
set of opinions on her work. The two
following critiques on <i>Mansfield Park</i>&mdash;apparently
from two ladies of the same family&mdash;will illustrate
the sort of want of comprehension from which the
author had to suffer when she got outside the limits
of her own immediate circle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p><i>Mrs. B.</i>&mdash;Much pleased with it: particularly with
the character of Fanny as being so very natural.
Thought Lady Bertram like herself. Preferred it to
either of the others; but imagined <i>that</i> might be
want of taste, as she did not understand wit.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Augusta B.</i> owned that she thought <i>S.
and S.</i> and <i>P. and P.</i> downright nonsense, but expected
to like <i>M. P.</i> better, and having finished the
first volume, flattered herself she had got through
the worst.</p></div>

<p>Meanwhile, the banking-house of Austen, Maunde,
and Tilson, had closed its doors; and on March 23,
1816, Henry Austen was declared a bankrupt: the
immediate cause of the collapse being the failure of
an Alton bank which the London firm had backed.
No personal extravagance was charged against
Henry; but he had the unpleasant sensation of starting
life over again, and of having caused serious loss
to several of his family, especially his brother Edward
and Mr. Leigh Perrot, who had gone sureties for him
on his appointment as Receiver-General for Oxfordshire.
Jane herself was fortunate in losing no more
than thirteen pounds&mdash;a portion of the profits of
<i>Mansfield Park</i>.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

<p>Henry Austen possessed an extraordinary elasticity
of nature which made a rebound from depression
easy&mdash;indeed, almost inevitable&mdash;in his case. He
returned at once to his original intention of taking
Orders, as if the intervening military and banking
career had been nothing more than an interruption
of his normal course. Nor was it merely
perfunctory performance of clerical duties to which
he looked forward: he was in earnest, and began<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
by making use of his former classical knowledge to
take up a serious study of the New Testament in the
original language. He seems to have been in advance
of his age in this respect; for when he went
to be examined by the Bishop, that dignitary, after
asking him such questions as he thought desirable, put
his hand on a book which lay near him on the table,
and which happened to be a Greek Testament, and
said: 'As for <i>this</i> book, Mr. Austen, I dare say it is
some years since either you or I looked into it.'</p>

<p>Henry Austen became in time an earnest preacher
of the evangelical school, and was for many years
perpetual curate of Bentley, near Alton. He did
not marry the 'Hanwell favourite,' but found a wife
after some years in Miss Eleanor Jackson, who
survived him.</p>

<p>It must have been somewhere about this time that
Jane Austen succeeded in recovering the MS. of <i>Northanger
Abbey</i>. An unsuccessful attempt to secure the
publication of the novel in the year 1809 has already
been noticed; but we learn from the <i>Memoir</i> that after
four works of hers had been published, and somewhat
widely circulated, one of her brothers (acting for her)
negotiated with the publisher who had bought it, and
found him very willing to receive back his money, and
resign all claim to the copyright. When the bargain
was concluded and the money paid, but not till then,
the negotiator had the satisfaction of informing him
that the work which had been so lightly esteemed
was by the author of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jane had been for some months engaged
on <i>Persuasion</i>. It was begun before she went
to London in the autumn of 1815 for the publication
of <i>Emma;</i> but that visit and all that happened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
to her during the winter must certainly have interrupted
its composition, and possibly modified its
tone. It is less high-spirited and more tender in its
description of a stricken heart than anything she
had attempted before.</p>

<p>In May, Cassandra and Jane left Chawton to spend
three weeks at Cheltenham, stopping with their
brother at Steventon, and with the Fowles at Kintbury
on the way, and again at Steventon on their
return. Jane must have been decidedly out of
health, for the change in her did not escape the notice
of her friends. But whatever was the exact state of
her health during the first half of this year, it did not
prevent her from being able, on July 18, to write
'Finis' at the end of the first draft of <i>Persuasion;</i>
and thereby hangs an interesting tale, which we cannot
do better than relate in the words of the <i>Memoir</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The book had been brought to an end in July;
and the re-engagement of the hero and heroine
effected in a totally different manner in a scene laid
at Admiral Croft's lodgings. But her performance
did not satisfy her. She thought it tame and flat,
and was desirous of producing something better.
This weighed upon her mind&mdash;the more so, probably,
on account of the weak state of her health; so that
one night she retired to rest in very low spirits.
But such depression was little in accordance with
her nature, and was soon shaken off. The next
morning she awoke to more cheerful views and
brighter inspirations; the sense of power revived;
and imagination resumed its course. She cancelled
the condemned chapter, and wrote two others,
entirely different, in its stead. The result is that we
possess the visit of the Musgrove party to Bath;
the crowded and animated scenes at the White Hart
Hotel; and the charming conversation between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
Captain Harville and Anne Elliot, overheard by
Captain Wentworth, by which the two faithful lovers
were at last led to understand each other's feelings.
The tenth and eleventh chapters of <i>Persuasion</i>, then,
rather than the actual winding-up of the story,
contain the latest of her printed compositions&mdash;her
last contribution to the entertainment of the
public. Perhaps it may be thought that she has
seldom written anything more brilliant; and that,
independent of the original manner in which the
<i>d&eacute;nouement</i> is brought about, the pictures of Charles
Musgrove's good-natured boyishness and of his wife's
jealous selfishness would have been incomplete without
these finishing strokes. The cancelled chapter
exists in manuscript. It is certainly inferior to the
two which were substituted for it; but it was such as
some writers and some readers might have been contented
with; and it contained touches which scarcely
any other hand could have given, the suppression of
which may be almost a matter of regret.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p></div>

<p>For the cancelled chapter in <i>Persuasion</i>, and
for other posthumous writings of the author, we will
refer our readers to the second edition of the <i>Memoir</i>.
They will not fail to note the delicate touches put
to the characters of the Crofts by the Admiral's
triumph over the servant who was 'denying' Mrs.
Croft, and by the frequent excursions of husband and
wife together 'upstairs to hear a noise, or downstairs
to settle their accounts, or upon the landing
to trim the lamp.' But the added chapters take one
altogether into a higher province of fiction, where
the deepest emotion and the most delicate humour
are blended in one scene: a scene that makes one
think that, had its author lived, we might have had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
later masterpieces of a different type from that of
their predecessors.</p>

<p><i>Persuasion</i> is of about the same length as
<i>Northanger Abbey</i>, and it seems natural to suppose
that there was some purpose in this similarity, and
that the two works were intended to be published
together&mdash;as in the end they were&mdash;each as a two-volume
novel. She certainly contemplated the
publication of <i>Northanger Abbey</i> (which at that stage
bore the name of <i>Catherine</i>) after she had recovered
it in 1816, and when she wrote the 'advertisement'
which appears in the first edition of the book.
Yet afterwards she seems rather to have gone back
from this intention. Writing to Fanny Knight,
March 13, 1817, she says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I <i>will</i> answer your kind questions more than
you expect. <i>Miss Catherine</i> is put upon the shelf
for the present, and I do not know that she will ever
come out; but I have a something ready for publication,
which may perhaps appear about a twelvemonth
hence. It is short&mdash;about the length of
<i>Catherine</i>. This is for yourself alone.</p></div>

<p><i>Catherine</i> is of course <i>Northanger Abbey</i>, and the
'something' is <i>Persuasion</i>. She returns to the
latter in writing again to Fanny, March 23, telling
her she will not like it, and adding 'You may
perhaps like the heroine, as she is almost too good
for me.'</p>

<p>Two remarkable points in these extracts are: the
statement that <i>Persuasion</i> was 'ready for publication,'
but was not to appear for a twelvemonth,
and the idea that the character of the heroine was,
as it were, imposed upon the author by an external
force which she was powerless to resist. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
intended delay in publishing <i>Persuasion</i> shows how
unwilling she was to let anything go till she was
quite sure she had polished it to the utmost: and
we may imagine that, had health returned, the one
comparatively dull and lifeless part of the book&mdash;the
long story of Mrs. Smith&mdash;would have been somehow
or other brought to life by touches which she knew
so well how to impart.</p>

<p>As for the doubt about publishing <i>Catherine</i> at all,
it was not unnatural. She might reasonably hesitate
to put an immature work by the side of her most
mature: she might (and we know that she <i>did</i>) feel
that the social usages of sixteen years ago, which
she was describing in this tale, were no longer those
of the day; and it was possible that a satire on
Mrs. Radcliffe was not what the public now wanted.
The members of the Austen family, who managed the
publication of her novels after her death, thought
differently; and we are grateful to them for having
done so.</p>

<p>Had she followed all the advice given her by
her friends, she would have produced something
very different from either <i>Northanger Abbey</i> or <i>Persuasion</i>.
It must have been in the course of the
year 1816 that she drew up the following 'plan of
a novel, according to hints from various quarters,'
adding below the names of the friends who gave the
hints.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Scene to be in the country. Heroine, the
daughter of a clergyman<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>: one who, after having
lived much in the world, had retired from it, and
settled on a curacy with a very small fortune of his
own. He, the most excellent man that can be
imagined, perfect in character, temper, and manners,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
without the smallest drawback or peculiarity to
prevent his being the most delightful companion
to his daughter from one year's end to the other.
Heroine,<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> a faultless character herself, perfectly good,
with much tenderness and sentiment and not the
least wit,<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> very highly accomplished,<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> understanding
modern languages, and (generally speaking) everything
that the most accomplished young women
learn, but particularly excelling in music&mdash;her favourite
pursuit&mdash;and playing equally well on the pianoforte
and harp, and singing in the first style. Her
person quite beautiful,<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> dark eyes and plump cheeks.
Book to open with the description of father and
daughter, who are to converse in long speeches,
elegant language, and a tone of high serious sentiment.
The father to be induced, at his daughter's
earnest request, to relate to her the past events of
his life. This narrative will reach through the
greater part of the first volume; as besides all the
circumstances of his attachment to her mother, and
their marriage, it will comprehend his going to sea
as chaplain<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> to a distinguished naval character
about the Court; his going afterwards to Court
himself, which introduced him to a great variety
of characters and involved him in many interesting
situations, concluding with his opinion of the benefits
of tithes being done away, and his having buried
his own mother (heroine's lamented grandmother) in
consequence of the High Priest of the parish in which
she died refusing to pay her remains the respect due
to them. The father to be of a very literary turn,
an enthusiast in literature, nobody's enemy but his
own; at the same time most zealous in the discharge
of his pastoral duties, the model of an exemplary
parish priest.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> The heroine's friendship to be sought
after by a young woman in the same neighbourhood,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
of talents and shrewdness, with light eyes and a
fair skin, but having a considerable degree of wit<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>;
heroine shall shrink from the acquaintance. From
this outset the story will proceed and contain a
striking variety of adventures. Heroine and her
father never above a fortnight together in one place<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>:
he being driven from his curacy by the vile arts of
some totally unprincipled and heartless young man,
desperately in love with the heroine, and pursuing
her with unrelenting passion. No sooner settled in
one country of Europe than they are necessitated to
quit it and retire to another, always making new
acquaintance, and always obliged to leave them.
This will, of course, exhibit a wide variety of characters,
but there will be no mixture. The scene will be
for ever shifting from one set of people to another;
but all the good<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> will be unexceptionable in every
respect, and there will be no foibles or weaknesses
but with the wicked, who will be completely depraved
and infamous, hardly a resemblance of humanity left
in them. Early in her career, in the progress of her
first removal, heroine must meet with the hero<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>&mdash;all
perfection, of course, and only prevented from paying
his addresses to her by some excess of refinement.
Wherever she goes somebody falls in love with her,
and she receives repeated offers of marriage, which
she always refers wholly to her father, exceedingly
angry that <i>he</i><a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> should not be first applied to. Often
carried away by the anti-hero, but rescued either by
her father or the hero. Often reduced to support
herself and her father by her talents, and work for
her bread; continually cheated and defrauded of her
hire; worn down to a skeleton, and now and then
starved to death. At last, hunted out of civilised
society, denied the poor shelter of the humblest
cottage, they are compelled to retreat into Kam<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>schatka,
where the poor father, quite worn down,
finding his end approaching, throws himself on the
ground, and, after four or five hours of tender advice
and parental admonition to his miserable child,
expires in a fine burst of literary enthusiasm, intermingled
with invectives against holders of tithes.
Heroine inconsolable for some time, but afterwards
crawls back towards her former country, having at
least twenty narrow escapes of falling into the hands
of anti-hero; and at last, in the very nick of time,
turning a corner to avoid him, runs into the arms
of the hero himself, who, having just shaken off the
scruples which fettered him before, was at the very
moment setting off in pursuit of her. The tenderest
and completest <i>&eacute;claircissement</i> takes place, and they
are happily united. Throughout the whole work
heroine to be in the most elegant society,<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> and living

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>AUNT JANE</h3>

<h3>1814-1817</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>Any</span> attempt at depicting the charm and attractiveness
of Jane Austen's character must be quite
incomplete if it fails to take into account the
special manner in which she showed these qualities
as an aunt. She herself says in joke to a young
niece that she had always maintained the importance
of aunts; and she evidently felt, in all
seriousness, the responsibility of that relationship,
though she would have been one of the last to
display her sense of it by any didactic or authoritative
utterance. The author of the <i>Memoir</i> tells
us that her two nieces who were grown up in her
lifetime could say how valuable to them had been
her advice in 'the little difficulties and doubts
of early womanhood'; and Lord Brabourne quotes
here and there extracts from his mother's diary,
such as these: 'Aunt Jane and I had a very
interesting conversation'; 'Aunt Jane and I had
a delicious morning together'; 'Aunt Jane and
I very snug'; and so on, until the sad ending:
'I had the misery of losing my dear Aunt Jane
after a lingering illness.'</div>

<p>Some letters of hers to three of her nieces give a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
good idea of her value and importance to them,
whether as grown women or as children.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>Fanny Knight, sensible as she was, and early
accustomed to responsibility, felt at a loss how to
distinguish in her own mind between inclination
and love when seriously courted in 1814 by a
man of unexceptionable position and character. A
reference to her aunt brought her two delightful
letters.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> No definite opinion was expressed or formal
advice given in these letters, but they must have
helped her by their sympathy, and cleared her mind
by the steadiness with which they contemplated the
case in all its bearings.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'><br />Chawton: Friday [November 18, 1814].
</div>

<p>I feel quite as doubtful as you could be, my
dearest Fanny, as to <i>when</i> my letter may be finished,
for I can command very little quiet time at present;
but yet I must begin, for I know you will be glad to
hear as soon as possible, and I really am impatient
myself to be writing something on so very interesting
a subject, though I have no hope of writing anything
to the purpose. I shall do very little more, I dare
say, than say over again what you have said before.</p>

<p>I was certainly a good deal surprised <i>at first</i>, as
I had no suspicion of any change in your feelings,
and I have no scruple in saying that you cannot be
in love. My dear Fanny, I am ready to laugh at
the idea, and yet it is no laughing matter to have
had you so mistaken as to your own feelings. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
with all my heart I wish I had cautioned you on that
point when first you spoke to me; but, though I
did not think you then <i>much</i> in love, I did consider
you as being attached in a degree quite sufficiently
for happiness, as I had no doubt it would increase
with opportunity, and from the time of our being
in London<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> together I thought you really very much
in love. But you certainly are not at all&mdash;there is
no concealing it.</p>

<p>What strange creatures we are! It seems as if
your being secure of him had made you indifferent.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>He is just what he ever was, only more evidently
and uniformly devoted to <i>you</i>. This is all the
difference. How shall we account for it?</p>

<p>My dearest Fanny, I am writing what will not be
of the smallest use to you. I am feeling differently
every moment, and shall not be able to suggest a
single thing that can assist your mind. I could
lament in one sentence and laugh in the next, but
as to opinion or counsel I am sure that none will be
extracted worth having from this letter.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Poor dear Mr. A.! Oh, dear Fanny! your mistake
has been one that thousands of women fall
into. He was the <i>first</i> young man who attached
himself to you. That was the charm, and most
powerful it is. Among the multitudes, however,
that make the same mistake with yourself, there can
be few indeed who have so little reason to regret it;
<i>his</i> character and <i>his</i> attachment leave you nothing
to be ashamed of.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, what is to be done? You have
no inclination for any other person. His situation
in life, family, friends, and, above all, his character,
his uncommonly amiable mind, strict principles, just
notions, good habits, <i>all</i> that <i>you</i> know so well how
to value, <i>all</i> that is really of the first importance&mdash;everything
of this nature pleads his cause most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
strongly. You have no doubt of his having superior
abilities, he has proved it at the University; he is,
I dare say, such a scholar as your agreeable, idle
brothers would ill bear a comparison with.</p>

<p>Oh, my dear Fanny! the more I write about him
the warmer my feelings become&mdash;the more strongly
I feel the sterling worth of such a young man and the
desirableness of your growing in love with him again.
I recommend this most thoroughly. There <i>are</i> such
beings in the world, perhaps one in a thousand, as the
creature you and I should think perfection, where
grace and spirit are united to worth, where the
manners are equal to the heart and understanding;
but such a person may not come in your way, or, if
he does, he may not be the eldest son of a man of
fortune, the near relation of your particular friend,
and belonging to your own county.</p>

<p>Think of all this, Fanny. Mr. A. has advantages
which we do not often meet in one person. His only
fault, indeed, seems modesty. If he were less modest
he would be more agreeable, speak louder, and look
impudenter; and is not it a fine character of which
modesty is the only defect? I have no doubt he
will get more lively and more like yourselves as he is
more with you; he will catch your ways if he belongs
to you. And, as to there being any objection from
his <i>goodness</i>, from the danger of his becoming even
evangelical, I cannot admit <i>that</i>. I am by no means
convinced that we ought not all to be evangelicals,
and am at least persuaded that they who are so from
reason and feeling must be happiest and safest.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>And now, my dear Fanny, having written so much
on one side of the question, I shall turn round and
entreat you not to commit yourself farther, and not
to think of accepting him unless you really do like
him. Anything is to be preferred or endured rather
than marrying without affection; and if his deficiencies
of manner, &amp;c. &amp;c., strike you more than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
all his good qualities, if you continue to think strongly
of them, give him up at once. Things are now in
such a state that you must resolve upon one or the
other&mdash;either to allow him to go on as he has done,
or whenever you are together behave with a coldness
which may convince him that he has been deceiving
himself. I have no doubt of his suffering a good
deal for a time&mdash;a great deal when he feels that he
must give you up; but it is no creed of mine, as you
must be well aware, that such sort of disappointments
kill anybody.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Yours very affectionately,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Jane Austen</span>.
</div>

<div class='right'><br />23 Hans Place: Wednesday [November 30, 1814].
</div>

<p>Now, my dearest Fanny, I will begin a subject
which comes in very naturally. You frighten me
out of my wits by your reference. Your affection
gives me the highest pleasure, but indeed you must
not let anything depend on my opinion; your own
feelings, and none but your own, should determine
such an important point. So far, however, as
answering your question, I have no scruple. I am
perfectly convinced that your present feelings, supposing
you were to marry <i>now</i>, would be sufficient
for his happiness; but when I think how very, very
far it is from a '<i>now</i>,' and take everything that
<i>may be</i> into consideration, I dare not say 'Determine
to accept him'; the risk is too great for <i>you</i>, unless
your own sentiments prompt it.</p>

<p>You will think me perverse perhaps; in my last
letter I was urging everything in his favour, and
now I am inclining the other way, but I cannot
help it; I am at present more impressed with the
possible evil that may arise to <i>you</i> from engaging
yourself to him&mdash;in word or mind&mdash;than with anything
else. When I consider how few young men
you have yet seen much of; how capable you are
(yes, I do still think you <i>very</i> capable) of being really<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
in love; and how full of temptation the next six
or seven years of your life will probably be (it is the
very period of life for the <i>strongest</i> attachments to
be formed)&mdash;I cannot wish you, with your present
very cool feelings, to devote yourself in honour to
him. It is very true that you never may attach
another man his equal altogether; but if that other
man has the power of attaching you <i>more</i>, he will
be in your eyes the most perfect.</p>

<p>I shall be glad if you <i>can</i> revive past feelings, and
from your unbiassed self resolve to go on as you have
done, but this I do not expect; and without it I
cannot wish you to be fettered. I should not be
afraid of your <i>marrying</i> him; with all his worth you
would soon love him enough for the happiness of
both; but I should dread the continuance of this
sort of tacit engagement, with such an uncertainty
as there is of <i>when</i> it may be completed. Years may
pass before he is independent; you like him well
enough to marry, but not well enough to wait; the
unpleasantness of appearing fickle is certainly great;
but if you think you want punishment for past
illusions, there it is, and nothing can be compared
to the misery of being bound <i>without</i> love&mdash;bound to
one, and preferring another; <i>that</i> is a punishment
which you do <i>not</i> deserve.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I shall be most glad to hear from you again, my
dearest Fanny, but it must not be later than Saturday,
as we shall be off on Monday long before the
letters are delivered; and write <i>something</i> that may
do to be read or told.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I cannot suppose we differ in our ideas of the
Christian religion. You have given an excellent
description of it. We only affix a different meaning
to the word <i>evangelical</i>.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Yours most affectionately,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">J. Austen</span>.</div>
<p><small>Miss Knight, Godmersham Park, Faversham, Kent.</small>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
</p></div>

<p>Two remarks in these letters seem to betray the
close observer of human nature from the novelist's
point of view. Her optimistic opinion as to recovery
from disappointments in love may perhaps be adduced
by some critics as an argument to show that her
feelings were not very deep; we should rather quote
them as an instance of her candour&mdash;of her saying
what other writers cannot help thinking, though they
may not like to express the thought. Readers of
<i>Persuasion</i> are well aware that the author made
room for cases (at all events, in the lives of women)
where such disappointments, though they may not
kill, yet give a sombre tone to the life and spirits of
the sufferer through a long series of years.</p>

<p>There is close observation also in the distinction
drawn between the amount of love sufficient for a
speedy marriage, and that necessary for a long engagement,
if unhappiness and possible discredit are
to be avoided. On this occasion, neither marriage
nor engagement happened to Fanny Knight. Her
son tells us that differences in religious ideas tended
by degrees to separate the lovers&mdash;if lovers they
could be called. Her doubt as to caring enough for
'Mr. A.' became a certainty in the course of the year
1815. When her aunt, in November of that year,
joked with her about an imaginary tenderness for
Mr. Haden, 'the apothecary,' it was no doubt pure
'chaff'; but we may be sure she would not have
indulged in it if any serious attachment had then
occupied her niece's mind.</p>

<p>The remaining letters of this series which we
possess were written, after an interval of more than
two years, in February and March 1817,<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> only a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
months before Jane's death. All idea of Fanny's
engaging herself to 'Mr. A.' has now passed away;
yet, with natural inconsistency, she lives in dread
of his marrying some one else. By this time there
is a 'Mr. B.' on the stage, but his courtship, though
apparently demonstrative, is not really serious;
and the last letter keeps away from love affairs
altogether. As to 'Mr. A.,' we are told that he
found his happiness elsewhere within a couple of
years; while Fanny became engaged to Sir Edward
Knatchbull in 1820.</p>

<div class='right'><br />Chawton: [February 20, 1817].
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dearest Fanny</span>,&mdash;You are inimitable, irresistible.
You are the delight of my life. Such letters,
such entertaining letters, as you have lately sent!
such a description of your queer little heart! such a
lovely display of what imagination does! You are
worth your weight in gold, or even in the new silver
coinage. I cannot express to you what I have felt
in reading your history of yourself&mdash;how full of pity
and concern, and admiration and amusement, I have
been! You are the paragon of all that is silly and
sensible, common-place and eccentric, sad and lively,
provoking and interesting. Who can keep pace with
the fluctuations of your fancy, the capprizios of your
taste, the contradictions of your feelings? You are
so odd, and all the time so perfectly natural!&mdash;so
peculiar in yourself, and yet so like everybody
else!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p>It is very, very gratifying to me to know you so
intimately. You can hardly think what a pleasure
it is to me to have such thorough pictures of your
heart. Oh, what a loss it will be when you are
married! You are too agreeable in your single
state&mdash;too agreeable as a niece. I shall hate you
when your delicious play of mind is all settled down
into conjugal and maternal affections.</p>

<p>Mr. B&mdash;&mdash; frightens me. He will have you. I
see you at the altar. I have <i>some</i> faith in Mrs. C.
Cage's observation, and still more in Lizzy's; and,
besides, I know it <i>must</i> be so. He must be wishing
to attach you. It would be too stupid and too
shameful in him to be otherwise; and all the family
are seeking your acquaintance.</p>

<p>Do not imagine that I have any real objection;
I have rather taken a fancy to him than not, and
I like the house for you. I only do not like you
should marry anybody. And yet I do wish you to
marry very much, because I know you will never be
happy till you are; but the loss of a Fanny Knight
will be never made up to me. My 'affec. niece
F. C. B&mdash;&mdash;' will be but a poor substitute. I do
not like your being nervous, and so apt to cry&mdash;it
is a sign you are not quite well.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I enjoy your visit to Goodnestone, it must be a
great pleasure to you; you have not seen Fanny
Cage in comfort so long. I hope she represents and
remonstrates and reasons with you properly. Why
should you be living in dread of his marrying
somebody else? (Yet, how natural!) You did not
choose to have him yourself, why not allow him to
take comfort where he can? In your conscience
you <i>know</i> that he could not bear a companion with a
more animated character. You cannot forget how
you felt under the idea of its having been possible
that he might have dined in Hans Place.</p>

<p>My dearest Fanny, I cannot bear you should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
be unhappy about him. Think of his principles;
think of his father's objection, of want of money,
&amp;c., &amp;c. But I am doing no good; no, all that I
urge against him will rather make you take his part
more, sweet, perverse Fanny.</p>

<p>And now I will tell you that we like your Henry
to the utmost, to the very top of the glass, quite
brimful. He is a very pleasing young man. I do
not see how he could be mended. He does really
bid fair to be everything his father and sister could
wish; and William I love very much indeed, and so
we do all; he is quite our own William. In short,
we are very comfortable together; that is, we can
answer for <i>ourselves</i>.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;I had no idea when I began this yesterday
of sending it before your brother went back,
but I have written away my foolish thoughts at such
a rate that I will not keep them many hours longer
to stare me in the face.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Ben and Anna walked here last Sunday to hear
Uncle Henry, and she looked so pretty, it was quite
a pleasure to see her, so young and so blooming,
and so innocent.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Your objection to the quadrilles delighted me
exceedingly. Pretty well, for a lady irrecoverably
attached to <i>one</i> person! Sweet Fanny, believe no
such thing of yourself, spread no such malicious
slander upon your understanding, within the precincts
of your imagination. Do not speak ill of your
sense merely for the gratification of your fancy;
yours is sense which deserves more honourable
treatment. You are <i>not</i> in love with him; you never
<i>have</i> been really in love with him.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Yours very affectionately,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">J. Austen</span>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></div>


<div class='right'><br />Chawton: Thursday [March 13, 1817].
</div>

<p>As to making any adequate return for such a
letter as yours, my dearest Fanny, it is absolutely
impossible. If I were to labour at it all the rest of
my life, and live to the age of Methuselah, I could
never accomplish anything so long and so perfect;
but I cannot let William go without a few lines of
acknowledgment and reply.</p>

<p>I have pretty well done with Mr. &mdash;&mdash;. By
your description, he <i>cannot</i> be in love with you,
however he may try at it; and I could not wish the
match unless there were a great deal of love on his
side.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Poor Mrs. C. Milles, that she should die on the
wrong day at last, after being about it so long!
It was unlucky that the Goodnestone party could
not meet you, and I hope her friendly, obliging, social
spirit, which delighted in drawing people together,
was not conscious of the division and disappointment
she was occasioning. I am sorry and surprised that
you speak of her as having little to leave, and must feel
for Miss Milles, though she <i>is</i> Molly, if a material loss
of income is to attend her other loss. Single women
have a dreadful propensity for being poor, which is
one very strong argument in favour of matrimony,
but I need not dwell on such arguments with <i>you</i>,
pretty dear.</p>

<p>To you I shall say, as I have often said before,
do not be in a hurry, the right man will come at
last; you will in the course of the next two or three
years meet with somebody more generally unexceptionable
than anyone you have yet known, who
will love you as warmly as possible, and who will
so completely attract you that you will feel you
never really loved before.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Aunt Cassandra walked to Wyards yesterday<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
with Mrs. Digweed. Anna has had a bad cold, and
looks pale. She has just weaned Julia.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Chawton: Sunday [March 23, 1817].
</div>

<p>I am very much obliged to you, my dearest
Fanny, for sending me Mr. W.'s conversation; I had
great amusement in reading it, and I hope I am not
affronted, and do not think the worse of him for
having a brain so very different from mine; but
my strongest sensation of all is <i>astonishment</i> at your
being able to press him on the subject so perseveringly;
and I agree with your papa, that it was
not fair. When he knows the truth he will be
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>You are the oddest creature! Nervous enough
in some respects, but in others perfectly without
nerves! Quite unrepulsable, hardened, and impudent.
Do not oblige him to read any more. Have
mercy on him, tell him the truth, and make him an
apology. He and I should not in the least agree,
of course, in our ideas of novels and heroines. Pictures
of perfection, as you know, make me sick and wicked;
but there is some very good sense in what he says,
and I particularly respect him for wishing to think
well of all young ladies; it shows an amiable and
a delicate mind. And he deserves better treatment
than to be obliged to read any more of my works.</p>

<p>Do not be surprised at finding Uncle Henry
acquainted with my having another ready for publication.
I could not say No when he asked me, but
he knows nothing more of it. You will not like it,
so you need not be impatient. You may <i>perhaps</i>
like the heroine, as she is almost too good for me.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Thank you for everything you tell me. I do not
feel worthy of it by anything that I can say in return,
but I assure you my pleasure in your letters is quite
as great as ever, and I am interested and amused
just as you could wish me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>
<p>The Papillons came back on Friday night, but
I have not seen them yet, as I do not venture to
church. I cannot hear, however, but that they are
the same Mr. P. and his sister they used to be.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Very affectionately yours,</span><br />

</div>


<p>Very different in tone and subject were the letters,
addressed about the same time as the two earlier of
this series, to her other niece, Anna. Not that Anna
was without her own love story: on the contrary,
it came to a straightforward and satisfactory climax
in her marriage to Ben Lefroy, which took place in
November 1814; and no doubt, she, like her cousin,
had received letters of sympathy and advice on the
realities of life from her aunt. Her own romance,
however, did not prevent her from interesting herself
in the creations of her brain: indeed, all the three
children of James Austen&mdash;Anna, Edward, and little
Caroline&mdash;had indulged freely in the delights of
authorship from a very youthful age. It was a novel
of Anna's which caused the present correspondence;
and we can see from the delicate hints of her aunt
that <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> and <i>Mansfield Park</i> had
not been without their influence over its matter
and style. Readers of these letters will note the
kindness with which Jane, now deep in the composition
of <i>Emma</i>, turns aside from her own work
to criticise and encourage, associating her views all
the time with those of Cassandra&mdash;who was to her
like a Court of Appeal&mdash;and allowing ample freedom
of judgment also to Anna herself. They will see
also that her vote is for 'nature and spirit,' above<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
everything; while yet she insists on the necessity
of accuracy of detail for producing the illusion of
truth in fiction.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'><br />[May or June, 1814.]
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Anna</span>,&mdash;I am very much obliged to you
for sending your MS. It has entertained me extremely;
all of us, indeed. I read it aloud to your
Grandmama and Aunt Cass, and we were all very
much pleased. The spirit does not droop at all.
Sir Thos., Lady Helena and St. Julian are very well
done, and Cecilia continues to be interesting in spite
of her being so amiable. It was very fit you should
advance her age. I like the beginning of Devereux
Forester very much, a great deal better than if he
had been very good or very bad. A few verbal
corrections are all that I felt tempted to make.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I do not like a lover speaking in the 3rd person;
it is too much like the formal part of Lord Orville,<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>
and, I think, is not natural. If <i>you</i> think differently,
however, you need not mind me. I am impatient
for more, and only wait for a safe conveyance to
return this book.</p>


<div class='right'><br />[August 10, 1814.]
</div>

<p>I like the name <i>Which is the Heroine</i> very well,
and I dare say shall grow to like it very much in time;
but <i>Enthusiasm</i> was something so very superior
that every common title must appear to disadvantage.
I am not sensible of any blunders about Dawlish;
the library was particularly pitiful and wretched
twelve years ago and not likely to have anybody's
publications. There is no such title as Desborough
either among dukes, marquises, earls, viscounts, or
barons. These were your inquiries. I will now
thank you for your envelope received this morning.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Your Aunt Cass is as well pleased with St. Julian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
as ever, and I am delighted with the idea of seeing
Progillian again.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday 17.</i>&mdash;We have now just finished the
first of the three books I had the pleasure of receiving
yesterday. I read it aloud and we are all very much
amused, and like the work quite as well as ever. I
depend on getting through another book before dinner,
but there is really a good deal of respectable reading
in your forty-eight pages. I have no doubt six will
make a very good-sized volume. You must be quite
pleased to have accomplished so much. I like Lord
Portman<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> and his brother very much. I am only
afraid that Lord P.'s good nature will make most
people like him better than he deserves. The whole
Portman family are very good, and Lady Anne,
who was your great dread, you have succeeded particularly
well with. Bell Griffin is just what she
should be. My corrections have not been more
important than before; here and there we have
thought the sense could be expressed in fewer words,
and I have scratched out Sir Thos. from walking with
the other men to the stables, &amp;c., the very day after
his breaking his arm; for, though I find your papa
did walk out immediately after <i>his</i> arm was set,
I think it can be so little usual as to appear unnatural
in a book.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Lyme will not do. Lyme is towards forty miles'
distance from Dawlish and would not be talked of
there. I have put Starcross instead. If you prefer
Exeter that must be always safe.</p>

<p>I have also scratched out the introduction between
Lord Portman and his brother and Mr. Griffin. A
country surgeon (don't tell Mr. C. Lyford) would not
be introduced to men of their rank.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I <i>do</i> think you had better omit Lady Helena's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
postscript. To those that are acquainted with
<i>Pride and Prejudice</i> it will seem an imitation.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>We are reading the last book. They must be
two days going from Dawlish to Bath. They are
nearly 100 miles apart.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;We finished it last night after our
return from drinking tea at the Great House. The
last chapter does not please us quite so well; we do
not thoroughly like the play, perhaps from having
had too much of plays in that way lately,<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> and we
think you had better not leave England. Let the
Portmans go to Ireland; but as you know nothing
of the manners there, you had better not go with
them. You will be in danger of giving false representations.
Stick to Bath and the Foresters. There
you will be quite at home.</p>

<p>Your Aunt C. does not like desultory novels, and
is rather afraid yours will be too much so, that there
will be too frequently a change from one set of people
to another, and that circumstances will be sometimes
introduced of apparent consequence which will
lead to nothing. It will not be so great an objection
to <i>me</i> if it does. I allow much more latitude than
she does, and think nature and spirit cover many
sins of a wandering story, and people in general do
not care so much about it for your comfort.</p>

<p>I should like to have had more of Devereux.
I do not feel enough acquainted with him. You
were afraid of meddling with him, I dare say. I like
your sketch of Lord Clanmurray, and your picture
of the two poor young girls' enjoyment is very good.
I have not yet noticed St. Julian's serious conversation
with Cecilia, but I like it exceedingly. What he
says about the madness of otherwise sensible women
on the subject of their daughters coming out is worth
its weight in gold.</p>

<p>I do not see that the language sinks. Pray go on.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<div class='right'><br />[September 9, 1814.]
</div>

<p>We have been very much amused by your three
books, but I have a good many criticisms to make,
more than you will like. We are not satisfied with
Mrs. Forester's settling herself as tenant and near
neighbour to such a man as Sir T. H., without having
some other inducement to go there. She ought to
have some friend living thereabouts to tempt her.
A woman going with two girls just growing up into
a neighbourhood where she knows nobody but one
man of not very good character, is an awkwardness
which so prudent a woman as Mrs. F. would not be
likely to fall into. Remember she is very prudent.
You must not let her act inconsistently. Give her
a friend, and let that friend be invited to meet her
at the Priory, and we shall have no objection to her
dining there as she does; but otherwise a woman in
her situation would hardly go there before she had
been visited by other families. I like the scene
itself, the Miss Lesleys, Lady Anne, and the music
very much.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Sir Thomas H. you always do
very well. I have only taken the liberty of expunging
one phrase of his which would not be allowable&mdash;'Bless
my heart!' It is too familiar and inelegant.
Your grandmother is more disturbed at Mrs. Forester's
not returning the Egertons' visit sooner than
by anything else. They ought to have called at the
Parsonage before Sunday. You describe a sweet
place, but your descriptions are often more minute
than will be liked. You give too many particulars
of right hand and left. Mrs. Forester is not careful
enough of Susan's health. Susan ought not to be
walking out so soon after heavy rains, taking long
walks in the dirt. An anxious mother would not
suffer it. I like your Susan very much indeed, she
is a sweet creature, her playfulness of fancy is very
delightful. I like her as she is now exceedingly, but
I am not quite so well satisfied with her behaviour
to George R. At first she seems all over attachment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
and feeling, and afterwards to have none at all; she
is so extremely composed at the ball and so well
satisfied apparently with Mr. Morgan. She seems to
have changed her character.</p>

<p>You are now collecting your people delightfully,
getting them exactly into such a spot as is the delight
of my life. Three or four families in a country village
is the very thing to work on, and I hope you will
write a great deal more, and make full use of them
while they are so very favourably arranged.</p>

<p>You are but <i>now</i> coming to the heart and beauty
of your book. Till the heroine grows up the fun
must be imperfect, but I expect a great deal of entertainment
from the next three or four books, and
I hope you will not resent these remarks by sending
me no more.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>They are not so much like the Papillons as I
expected. Your last chapter is very entertaining,
the conversation on genius, &amp;c.; Mr. St. Julian and
Susan both talk in character, and very well. In
some former parts Cecilia is perhaps a little too solemn
and good, but upon the whole her disposition is very
well opposed to Susan's, her want of imagination is
very natural. I wish you could make Mrs. Forester
talk more; but she must be difficult to manage and
make entertaining, because there is so much good
common sense and propriety about her that nothing
can be made very <i>broad</i>. Her economy and her
ambition must not be staring. The papers left by
Mrs. Fisher are very good. Of course one guesses
something. I hope when you have written a great
deal more, you will be equal to scratching out some
of the past. The scene with Mrs. Mellish I should
condemn; it is prosy and nothing to the purpose;
and indeed the more you can find in your heart to
curtail between Dawlish and Newton Priors, the
better I think it will be&mdash;one does not care for girls
till they are grown up. Your Aunt C. quite enters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
into the exquisiteness of that name&mdash;Newton Priors
is really a nonpareil. Milton would have given his
eyes to have thought of it. Is not the cottage taken
from Tollard Royal?</p>


<div class='right'><br />[September 28, 1814.]
</div>

<p>I hope you do not depend on having your book
again immediately. I kept it that your grandmama
may hear it, for it has not been possible yet to have
any public reading. I have read it to your Aunt
Cassandra, however, in our own room at night, while
we undressed, and with a great deal of pleasure. We
like the first chapter extremely, with only a little
doubt whether Lady Helena is not almost too foolish.
The matrimonial dialogue is very good certainly.
I like Susan as well as ever, and begin now not to
care at all about Cecilia; she may stay at Easton
Court as long as she likes. Henry Mellish, I am
afraid, will be too much in the common novel style&mdash;a
handsome, amiable, unexceptionable young man
(such as do not much abound in real life), desperately
in love and all in vain. But I have no business
to judge him so early.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>We feel really obliged to you for introducing a
Lady Kenrick; it will remove the greatest fault in
the work, and I give you credit for considerable
forbearance as an author in adopting so much of our
opinion. I expect high fun about Mrs. Fisher and
Sir Thomas.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Devereux Forester's being ruined by his vanity
is extremely good, but I wish you would not let him
plunge into a 'vortex of dissipation.' I do not object
to the thing, but I cannot bear the expression; it is
such thorough novel slang, and so old that I dare say
Adam met with it in the first novel he opened.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Walter Scott has no business to write novels,
especially good ones. It is not fair. He has fame<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
and profit enough as a poet, and should not be
taking the bread out of other people's mouths.</p>

<p>I do not like him, and do not mean to like
<i>Waverley</i><a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> if I can help it, but fear I must.</p>

<p>I am quite determined, however, not to be pleased
with Mrs. West's <i>Alicia De Lacy</i>, should I ever meet
with it, which I hope I shall not. I think I <i>can</i>
be stout against anything written by Mrs. West.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>
I have made up my mind to like no novels really
but Miss Edgeworth's, yours, and my own.</p>

<p>What can you do with Egerton to increase the
interest for him? I wish you could contrive something,
some family occurrence to bring out his good
qualities more. Some distress among brothers and
sisters to relieve by the sale of his curacy! Something
to carry him mysteriously away, and then be
heard of at York or Edinburgh in an old great coat.
I would not seriously recommend anything improbable,
but if you could invent something spirited for
him it would have a good effect. He might lend all
his money to Captain Morris, but then he would be
a great fool if he did. Cannot the Morrises quarrel
and he reconcile them? Excuse the liberty I take
in these suggestions.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The Webbs are really gone! When I saw the
wagons at the door, and thought of all the trouble
they must have in moving, I began to reproach
myself for not having liked them better, but since
the wagons have disappeared my conscience has
been closed again, and I am excessively glad they
are gone.</p>

<p>I am very fond of Sherlock's sermons and prefer
them to almost any.</p></div>

<p>Anna's marriage took place on November 8. Her
husband was afterwards a clergyman, but he did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
not take Orders until about three years after the
marriage; and the first home of the young couple
was at Hendon, to which place the following letter
was addressed, Jane being at that time with her
brother Henry, in Hans Place:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'><br />Hans Place: [November 28, 1814].
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Anna</span>,&mdash;I assure you we all came away
very much pleased with our visit. We talked of
you for about a mile and a half with great satisfaction;
and I have been just sending a very good
report of you to Miss Benn, with a full account of
your dress for Susan and Maria.</p>

<p>We were all at the play last night to see Miss
O'Neill in <i>Isabella</i>. I do not think she was quite
equal to my expectations. I fancy I want something
more than can be. I took two pocket-handkerchiefs,
but had very little occasion for either.
She is an elegant creature, however, and hugs Mr.
Young delightfully. I am going this morning to
see the little girls in Keppel Street. Cassy was
excessively interested about your marriage when
she heard of it, which was not until she was to drink
your health on the wedding day.</p>

<p>She asked a thousand questions in her usual
manner, what he said to you and what you said to
him. If your uncle were at home he would send his
best love, but I will not impose any base fictitious
remembrances on you. Mine I can honestly give,
and remain</p>

<div class='signature'>

<p>Early in December, Anna sent her aunt another
packet, which elicited the following letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'><br />Hans Place: Wednesday.
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Anna</span>,&mdash;I have been very far from
finding your book an evil, I assure you. I read it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
immediately, and with great pleasure. I think you
are going on very well. The description of Dr.
Griffin and Lady Helena's unhappiness is very good,
just what was likely to be. I am curious to know
what the end of <i>them</i> will be. The name of Newton
Priors is really invaluable; I never met with anything
superior to it. It is delightful; one could live
upon the name of Newton Priors for a twelvemonth.
Indeed, I do think you get on very fast. I only
wish other people of my acquaintance could compose
as rapidly. I am pleased with the dog scene and
with the whole of George and Susan's love, but am
more particularly struck with your <i>serious</i> conversations,
etc. They are very good throughout.
St. Julian's history was quite a surprise to me. You
had not very long known it yourself, I suspect; but
I have no objection to make to the circumstance,
and it is very well told. His having been in love
with the aunt gives Cecilia an additional interest
with him. I like the idea&mdash;a very proper compliment
to an aunt! I rather imagine indeed that
nieces are seldom chosen but out of compliment to
some aunt or another. I dare say Ben was in love
with me once, and would never have thought of you
if he had not supposed me dead of a scarlet fever.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>[Mrs. Heathcote] writes me word that Miss Blachford
is married, but I have never seen it in the papers,
and one may as well be single if the wedding is not
to be in print.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Your affectionate Aunt,</span><br />

</div></div>

<p>In August 1815 the Lefroys moved from Hendon,
and took a small house called Wyards, near Alton,
and within a walk of Chawton. Wyards is more
than once mentioned in our letters.</p>

<p>This is the last letter we possess dealing with
Anna's story; and we can understand that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
attention of either writer was soon diverted from it
by more serious considerations: that of Anna by
family cares, that of her aunt by Henry's illness and
bankruptcy, and by her own publication of <i>Emma</i>
and subsequent failure of health. The last history
of the MS. was sad enough. After the death of her
kind critic, Anna could not induce herself to go on
with the tale; the associations were too melancholy.
Long afterwards, she took it out of its drawer, and,
in a fit of despondency, threw it into the fire. Her
daughter, who tells us this, adds that she herself&mdash;a
little girl&mdash;was sitting on the rug, and remembers that
she watched the destruction, amused with the flame.</p>

<p>A similar fate befell a tragedy written at a very
early age by Anna's little sister Caroline, who was
her junior by about twelve years. Caroline believed
it to be a necessary part of a tragedy that all the
<i>dramatis personae</i> should somehow meet their end,
by violence or otherwise, in the last act; and this
belief produced such a scene of carnage and woe as
to cause fits of laughter among unsympathetic elders,
and tears to the author, who threw the unfortunate
tragedy into the fire on the spot.</p>

<p>Caroline, however, continued to write stories;
and some of them are alluded to in a series of little
childish letters written to her by her Aunt Jane, which
survive, carefully pieced together with silver paper
and gum, and which are worth preserving for the
presence in them of love and playfulness, and the
entire absence of condescension.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'><br />December 6.
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Caroline</span>,&mdash;I wish I could finish stories
as fast as you can. I am much obliged to you for
the sight of Olivia, and think you have done for her
very well; but the good-for-nothing father, who was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
the real author of all her faults and sufferings, should
not escape unpunished. I hope <i>he</i> hung himself,
or took the sur-name of <i>Bone</i> or underwent some
direful penance or other.</p>

<div class='right'><br />Chawton: Monday, July 15.
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Caroline</span>,&mdash;I have followed your directions
and find your handwriting admirable. If you
continue to improve as much as you have done,
perhaps I may not be obliged to shut my eyes at all
half a year hence. I have been very much entertained
by your story of Carolina and her aged father;
it made me laugh heartily, and I am particularly glad
to find you so much alive upon any topic of such
absurdity, as the usual description of a heroine's
father. You have done it full justice, or, if anything
be wanting, it is the information of the venerable
old man's having married when only twenty-one,
and being a father at twenty-two.</p>

<p>I had an early opportunity of conveying your
letter to Mary Jane, having only to throw it out of
window at her as she was romping with your brother
in the Back Court. She thanks you for it, and
answers your questions through me. I am to tell
you that she has passed her time at Chawton very
pleasantly indeed, that she does not miss Cassy so
much as she expected, and that as to <i>Diana Temple</i>,
she is ashamed to say it has never been worked at
since you went away.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Edward's visit has been a great pleasure to us.
He has not lost one good quality or good look, and
is only altered in being improved by being some
months older than when we saw him last. He is
getting very near our own age, for <i>we</i> do not grow
older of course.</p>

<div class='right'><br />Chawton: Wednesday, March. 13 [1815].
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Caroline</span>,&mdash;I am very glad to have an
opportunity of answering your agreeable little letter.
You seem to be quite my own niece in your feelings
towards Mme. de Genlis. I do not think I could
even now, at my sedate time of life, read <i>Olympe et
Th&eacute;ophile</i> without being in a rage. It really is too
bad! Not allowing them to be happy together
when they <i>are</i> married. Don't talk of it, pray. I
have just lent your Aunt Frank the first volume of
<i>Les Veill&eacute;es du Ch&acirc;teau</i>, for Mary Jane to read. It
will be some time before she comes to the horror of
Olympe.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>I had a very nice letter from your brother not
long ago, and I am quite happy to see how much
his hand is improving. I am convinced that it will
end in a very gentlemanlike hand, much above par.</p>

<p>We have had a great deal of fun lately with post-chaises
stopping at the door; three times within a
few days we had a couple of agreeable visitors turn
in unexpectedly&mdash;your Uncle Henry and Mr. Tilson,
Mrs. Heathcote and Miss Bigg, your Uncle Henry
and Mr. Seymour. Take notice it was the same
Uncle Henry each time.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">I remain, my dear Caroline,</span><br />
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Your affectionate Aunt,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">J. Austen</span>.
</div>


<div class='right'><br />Hans Place: Monday night [October 30, 1815].
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Caroline</span>,&mdash;I have not felt quite equal
to taking up your Manuscript, but think I shall
soon, and I hope my detaining it so long will be no
inconvenience. It gives us great pleasure that you
should be at Chawton. I am sure Cassy must be
delighted to have you. You will practise your music
of course, and I trust to you for taking care of my
instrument and not letting it be ill-used in any
respect. Do not allow anything to be put on it but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
what is very light. I hope you will try to make
out some other tune besides the Hermit.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>I am sorry you got wet in your ride; now that
you are become an Aunt<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> you are a person of some
consequence and must excite great interest whatever
you do. I have always maintained the importance
of Aunts as much as possible, and I am sure of your
doing the same now.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">Believe me, my dear Sister-Aunt,</span><br />
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Yours affectionately,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">J. Austen</span>.
</div>


<div class='right'><br />[January 23, 1817.]
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Caroline</span>,&mdash;I am always very much
obliged to you for writing to me, and have now I
believe two or three notes to thank you for; but
whatever may be their number, I mean to have this
letter accepted as a handsome return for all, for you
see I have taken a complete, whole sheet of paper,
which is to entitle me to consider it as a very long
letter whether I write much or little.</p>

<p>We were quite happy to see Edward, it was an
unexpected pleasure, and he makes himself as agreeable
as ever, sitting in such a quiet comfortable way
making his delightful little sketches. He is generally
thought grown since he was here last, and rather
thinner, but in very good looks.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He read his two
chapters to us the first evening&mdash;both good, but
especially the last in our opinion. We think it has
more of the spirit and entertainment of the early
part of his work.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>I feel myself getting stronger than I was half a
year ago, and can so perfectly well walk to Alton,
<i>or</i> back again, without the slightest fatigue that I
hope to be able to do both when summer comes. I
spent two or three days with your Uncle and Aunt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>
lately, and though the children are sometimes very
noisy and not under such order as they ought and
easily might, I cannot help liking them and even
loving them, which I hope may be not wholly
inexcusable in their and your affectionate Aunt,</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span class="smcap">J. Austen</span>.
</div>


<p>The Pianoforte often talks of you; in various
keys, tunes, and expressions, I allow&mdash;but be it
Lesson or Country Dance, Sonata or Waltz, <i>you</i> are
really its constant theme. I wish you could come
and see us, as easily as Edward can.</p>

<div class='signature'>
J. A.
</div>


<div class='right'><br />Wednesday night. [1817.]
</div>

<p>You send me great news indeed, my dear Caroline,
about Mr. Digweed, Mr. Trimmer, and a Grand
Pianoforte. I wish it had been a small one, as then
you might have pretended that Mr. D.'s rooms were
too damp to be fit for it, and offered to take charge
of it at the Parsonage.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I look forward to the four new chapters with
pleasure.&mdash;But how can you like Frederick better
than Edgar? You have some eccentric tastes however,
I know, as to Heroes and Heroines. Goodbye.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Yours affectionately,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">J. Austen</span>.
</div>


<div class='right'><br />Chawton: Wednesday, March 26 [1817].
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Caroline</span>,&mdash;Pray make no apologies
for writing to me often, I am always very happy
to hear from you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>I think you very much improved in your writing,
and in the way to write a very pretty hand. I wish
you could practise your fingering oftener. Would
not it be a good plan for you to go and live entirely
at Mr. Wm. Digweed's? He could not desire any
other remuneration than the pleasure of hearing you
practise.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>

<p>I like Frederick and Caroline better than I did,
but must still prefer Edgar and Julia. Julia is a
warm-hearted, ingenuous, natural girl, which I like
her for; but I know the word <i>natural</i> is no recommendation
to you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>How very well Edward is looking! You can have
nobody in your neighbourhood to vie with him at
all, except Mr. Portal. I have taken one ride on the
donkey and like it very much&mdash;and you must try to
get me quiet, mild days, that I may be able to go out
pretty constantly. A great deal of wind does not
suit me, as I have still a tendency to rheumatism.
In short I am a poor honey at present. I will be
better when you can come and see us.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Yours affectionately,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">J. Austen</span>.

<p>Caroline Austen contributed to the <i>Memoir</i> written
by her brother many of the personal reminiscences
of their aunt. She was the niece to whom Jane
in her last illness sent a recommendation to read
more and write less during the years of girlhood.
Caroline obeyed the injunction; she became a very
well-read woman, and never wrote stories for publication.
She was, however, an admirable talker: able
to invest common things with a point and spirit
peculiarly her own. She was also an ideal aunt,
both to nieces and nephews, who all owe a great
deal to her companionship and devotion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>FAILING HEALTH</h3>

<h3>1816-1817</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>During</span> the last year of Jane Austen's life, when her
health was gradually failing, and she was obliged to
depend&mdash;ever more and more exclusively&mdash;on her
immediate family for society, she had at least the
satisfaction of having her two sailor brothers nearer
at hand than had often been the case.</div>

<p>After Frank's return from the Baltic, early in 1814,
nothing occurred of a more serious nature than the
Great Naval Review in June&mdash;which only indirectly
affected him, as he was not then in command of a ship&mdash;to
prevent his attending to his family. He settled
down to a domestic life with wife and children, first
of all occupying the Great House at Chawton, but
soon moving to Alton.</p>

<p>Charles, who for ten years had had active but
unexciting work outside the theatre of war, now came
more to the front. Commanding the <i>Ph&oelig;nix</i> frigate,
he operated against Murat, when that eccentric sovereign
took part with Napoleon on the escape of the
latter from Elba. Charles was sent in pursuit of a
Neapolitan squadron cruising in the Adriatic; and
subsequently he blockaded Brindisi, and waited for
the garrison to hoist the white flag of the Bourbons.
Later on, he was kept busy with Greek pirates in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
Archipelago, until the <i>Ph&oelig;nix</i> was lost off Smyrna
in 1816, when he returned home. The <i>Ph&oelig;nix</i> had
been a lucky ship, Admiral Halsted having made his
fortune in her; but her luck was worn out. When
she went down, the pilot was on board; no lives
were lost, and no blame fell on the captain. It must
have been, however, a disappointing end to an
exciting time; and, as the war was over, it might
be long before he got another ship.</p>

<p>A letter from Charles to Jane, during this
command, written from Palermo, May 6, 1815,
furnishes us with one of the few indications that exist
of fame achieved by her during her lifetime:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Books became the subject of conversation, and I
praised <i>Waverley</i> highly, when a young man present
observed that nothing had come out for years to be
compared with <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>,
&amp;c. As I am sure you must be anxious to
know the name of a person of so much taste, I shall
tell you it is Fox, a nephew of the late Charles James
Fox. That you may not be too much elated at this
morsel of praise, I shall add that he did not appear
to like <i>Mansfield Park</i> so well as the two first, in
which, however, I believe he is singular.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p></div>

<p>We may compare this account with the quotation
given in the <i>Memoir</i><a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> from Sir Henry Holland's
<i>Recollections:</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I have the picture before me still of Lord Holland
lying on his bed, when attacked with gout; his
admirable sister, Miss Fox, reading aloud&mdash;as she
always did on these occasions&mdash;some one of Miss
Austen's novels, of which he was never wearied.</p></div>

<p>It is as difficult to follow the various stages of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
Jane's illness as it is to understand the exact nature
of her complaint. She must have begun to feel her
malady early in the year 1816; for some friends at a
distance, whom she visited in the spring, 'thought
that her health was somewhat impaired, and observed
that she went about her old haunts and recalled the
old recollections connected with them in a particular
manner&mdash;as if she did not expect ever to see them
again.'<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> This is, however, almost the only indication
that we have of any diminution of vigour at that
time; for the three letters to Fanny Knight, given by
Lord Brabourne as written in 1816, must be transferred
to 1817<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>; and so must the two short extracts<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>
on pp. 150, 151 of the <i>Memoir</i>, as they evidently refer
to a family event which occurred in the March of
the later year. The tone of her letters through the
remainder of 1816, and at the beginning of the next
year, was almost invariably cheerful, and she showed
by the completion of <i>Persuasion</i> that she was
capable of first-rate literary work during the summer
of 1816. The fact is that, as to health, she was an
incurable optimist; her natural good spirits made
her see the best side, and her unselfishness prompted
the suppression of anything that might distress those
around her. Nothing, for instance, could be more
lively than the following letter to Edward Austen,
written while he was still at Winchester School, but
had come home for his last summer holidays.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'><br />Chawton: July 9, 1816.
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Edward</span>,&mdash;Many thanks. A thank for
every line, and as many to Mr. W. Digweed for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
coming. We have been wanting very much to hear of
your mother, and are happy to find she continues to
mend, but her illness must have been a very serious
one indeed. When she is really recovered, she ought
to try change of air, and come over to us. Tell
your father I am very much obliged to him for his
share of your letter, and most sincerely join in the
hope of her being eventually much the better for her
present discipline. She has the comfort moreover of
being confined in such weather as gives one little
temptation to be out. It is really too bad, and has
been too bad for a long time, much worse than anybody
<i>can</i> bear, and I begin to think it will never be
fine again. This is a <i>finesse</i> of mine, for I have often
observed that if one writes about the weather, it is
generally completely changed before the letter is
read. I wish it may prove so now, and that when
Mr. W. Digweed reaches Steventon to-morrow, he
may find you have had a long series of hot dry
weather. We are a small party at present, only
grandmamma, Mary Jane, and myself. Yalden's
coach cleared off the rest yesterday.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>I am glad you recollected to mention your being
come home. My heart began to sink within me when
I had got so far through your letter without its being
mentioned. I was dreadfully afraid that you might
be detained at Winchester by severe illness, confined
to your bed perhaps, and quite unable to hold a pen,
and only dating from Steventon in order, with a
mistaken sort of tenderness, to deceive me. But now
I have no doubt of your being at home, I am sure
you would not say it so seriously unless it actually
were so. We saw a countless number of post-chaises
full of boys pass by yesterday morning<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>&mdash;full of future
heroes, legislators, fools, and villains. You have
never thanked me for my last letter, which went by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
the cheese. I cannot bear not to be thanked. You
will not pay us a visit yet of course; we must not
think of it. Your mother must get well first, and
you must go to Oxford and <i>not</i> be elected; after that
a little change of scene may be good for you, and
your physicians I hope will order you to the sea, or
to a house by the side of a very considerable pond.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>
Oh! it rains again. It beats against the window.
Mary Jane and I have been wet through once already
to-day; we set off in the donkey-carriage for Farringdon,
as I wanted to see the improvements Mr.
Woolls is making, but we were obliged to turn back
before we got there, but not soon enough to avoid
a pelter all the way home. We met Mr. Woolls. I
talked of its being bad weather for the hay, and he
returned me the comfort of its being much worse
for the wheat. We hear that Mrs. S. does not quit
Tangier: why and wherefore? Do you know that
our Browning is gone? You must prepare for a
William when you come, a good-looking lad, civil
and quiet, and seeming likely to do. Good bye. I
am sure Mr. W. D. will be astonished at my writing
so much, for the paper is so thin that he will be able
to count the lines if not to read them.</p>

<p><small>Mr. J. E. Austen.</small></p>
</div>

<p>There was a second family visit this year to
Cheltenham, where Cassandra and Jane had already
been in the spring. Probably their connexion with
this watering-place was through Mrs. James Austen,
and <i>hers</i> was through her sister, Mrs. Fowle of
Kintbury. Mr. Fowle had lived at Elkstone near
Cheltenham, and continued to hold that benefice,
which was in the gift of the Craven family. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
Fowles would naturally renew their intercourse with
their old friends in the neighbourhood, and <i>he</i> would
go to see his curate and acquaint himself with the
circumstances of his parish. The visits to Gloucestershire
were therefore for pleasure and business as well
as health.</p>

<p>In August 1816 it was a recent serious illness of
Mrs. James Austen which took the party there;
Mrs. Austen being accompanied by her daughter
Caroline, and her sister-in-law Cassandra. Meanwhile,
Jane remained with her mother at Chawton,
where she had Edward Austen as a visitor.</p>

<p>During Cassandra's absence Jane wrote to her as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'><br />Chawton: September 4, 1816.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>
</div>

<p>We go on very well here, Edward is a great
pleasure to me; he drove me to Alton yesterday.
I went principally to carry news of you and Henry,
and made a regular handsome visit, staying there
while Edward went on to Wyards with an invitation
to dinner: it was declined, and will be so again to-day
probably, for I really believe Anna is not equal to
the fatigue. The Alton four drank tea with us last
night, and we were very pleasant:&mdash;Jeu de Violon,
&amp;c.&mdash;all new to Mr. Sweney&mdash;and he entered into it
very well. It was a renewal of former agreeable
evenings.</p>

<p>We all (except my mother) dine at Alton tomorrow,
and perhaps may have some of the same
sports again, but I do not think Mr. and Mrs. D. will
add much to our wit. Edward is writing a novel&mdash;we
have all heard what he has written&mdash;it is extremely
clever, written with great ease and spirit;
if he can carry it on in the same way it will be a first-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>rate
work, and in a style, I think, to be popular.
Pray tell Mary how much I admire it&mdash;and tell
Caroline that I think it is hardly fair upon her and
myself to have him take up the novel line.</p>


<div class='right'><br />Sunday [September 8].
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dearest Cassandra</span>,&mdash;I have borne the
arrival of your letter to-day extremely well; anybody
might have thought it was giving me pleasure.
I am very glad you find so much to be satisfied with
at Cheltenham. While the waters agree, everything
else is trifling.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Our day at Alton was very pleasant, venison
quite right, children well-behaved, and Mr. and Mrs.
Digweed taking kindly to our charades and other
games. I must also observe, for his mother's satisfaction,
that Edward at my suggestion devoted himself
very properly to the entertainment of Miss S.
Gibson. Nothing was wanting except Mr. Sweney,
but he, alas! had been ordered away to London the
day before. We had a beautiful walk home by
moonlight.</p>

<p>Thank you, my back has given me scarcely any
pain for many days. I have an idea that agitation
does it as much harm as fatigue, and that I was ill
at the time of your going from the very circumstance
of your going. I am nursing myself up now into as
beautiful a state as I can, because I hear that Dr.
White means to call on me before he leaves the
country.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I have not seen Anna since the day you left us;
her father and brother visited her most days. Edward<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>
and Ben called here on Thursday. Edward was in
his way to Selborne. We found him very agreeable.
He is come back from France, thinking of the French<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
as one could wish&mdash;disappointed in everything. He
did not go beyond Paris.</p>

<p>I have a letter from Mrs. Perigord; she and her
mother are in London again. She speaks of France
as a scene of general poverty and misery: no money,
no trade, nothing to be got but by the innkeepers,
and as to her own present prospects she is not much
less melancholy than before.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I enjoyed Edward's company very much, as I
said before, and yet I was not sorry when Friday
came. It had been a busy week, and I wanted a few
days' quiet and exemption from the thought and
contrivancy which any sort of company gives. I
often wonder how <i>you</i> can find time for what you do,
in addition to the care of the house; and how good
Mrs. West<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> could have written such books and collected
so many hard words, with all her family cares, is still
more a matter of astonishment. Composition seems
to me impossible with a head full of joints of mutton
and doses of rhubarb.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>We do not much like Mr. Cooper's new sermons.
They are fuller of regeneration and conversion than
ever, with the addition of his zeal in the cause of the
Bible Society.</p></div>

<p>This is the last letter which we have from Jane to
Cassandra. Probably the sisters were not parted
again, except when Cassandra went for a few days
to Scarlets, on the death of their uncle, Mr. Leigh
Perrot, at the end of the following March; and if
Jane wrote then, it must have been in such depression
of mind and weakness of body, that her sister would
not have preserved the writing for others to see.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, the autumn of 1816 was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
probably occupied with the preparation of <i>Persuasion</i>
for the press; and, on the whole, we should gather
from the evidence before us that the earlier part of
the winter saw one of those fallacious instances of
temporary improvement which so often deceive
nurses and patients alike, in cases of internal complaints.
'I have certainly gained strength through
the winter,' she says, on January 24, 1817. On the
23rd: 'I feel myself stronger than I was half a year
ago'; and it was in this spirit of hopefulness that
she had written the following lively letter to Edward
Austen, when he had left Winchester and was
about to enter on the career of an Oxford undergraduate.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'><br />Chawton: Monday [December 16, 1816].
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Edward</span>,&mdash;One reason for my writing
to you now is, that I may have the pleasure of directing
to you <i>Esq<sup>re.</sup></i> I give you joy of having left
Winchester. Now you may own how miserable you
were there; now it will gradually all come out, your
crimes and your miseries&mdash;how often you went up
by the Mail to London and threw away fifty guineas
at a tavern, and how often you were on the point of
hanging yourself, restrained only, as some ill-natured
aspersion upon poor old Winton has it, by the want
of a tree within some miles of the city. Charles
Knight and his companions passed through Chawton
about 9 this morning; later than it used to be.
Uncle Henry and I had a glimpse of his handsome
face, looking all health and good humour. I wonder
when you will come and see us. I know what I
rather speculate upon, but shall say nothing. We
think uncle Henry in excellent looks. Look at him
this moment, and think so too, if you have not done
it before; and we have the great comfort of seeing
decided improvement in uncle Charles, both as to
health, spirits, and appearance. And they are each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
of them so agreeable in their different way, and
harmonise so well, that their visit is thorough enjoyment.
Uncle Henry writes very superior sermons.
You and I must try to get hold of one or two, and
put them into our novels: it would be a fine help to
a volume; and we could make our heroine read it
aloud of a Sunday evening, just as well as Isabella
Wardour, in <i>The Antiquary</i>, is made to read the
<i>History of the Hartz Demon</i>, in the ruins of St.
Ruth; though I believe, upon recollection, Lovell is
the reader. By the bye, my dear Edward, I am
quite concerned for the loss your mother mentions
in her letter. Two chapters and a half to be missing
is monstrous! It is well that <i>I</i> have not been at
Steventon lately, and therefore cannot be suspected
of purloining them: two strong twigs and a half towards
a nest of my own would have been something.
I do not think, however, that any theft of that sort
would be really very useful to me. What should I
do with your strong, manly, spirited sketches, full
of variety and glow? How could I possibly join
them on to the little bit (two inches wide) of ivory
on which I work with so fine a brush, as produces
little effect after much labour?</p>

<p>You will hear from uncle Henry how well Anna
is. She seems perfectly recovered. Ben was here on
Saturday, to ask uncle Charles and me to dine with
them, as to-morrow, but I was forced to decline it,
the walk is beyond my strength (though I am otherwise
very well), and this is not a season for donkey-carriages;
and as we do not like to spare uncle
Charles, he has declined it too.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i> Ah, ha! Mr. Edward. I doubt your
seeing uncle Henry at Steventon to-day. The
weather will prevent your expecting him, I think.
Tell your father, with aunt Cass's love and mine,
that the pickled cucumbers are extremely good,
and tell him also&mdash;'tell him what you will.' No,
don't tell him what you will, but tell him that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
grandmamma begs him to make Joseph Hall pay his
rent, if he can.</p>

<p>You must not be tired of reading the word <i>uncle</i>,
for I have not done with it. Uncle Charles thanks
your mother for her letter; it was a great pleasure
to him to know the parcel was received and gave
so much satisfaction, and he begs her to be so good
as to give three shillings for him to Dame Staples,
which shall be allowed for in the payment of her
debt here.</p>

<p>I am happy to tell you that Mr. Papillon will
soon make his offer, probably next Monday, as he
returns on Saturday. His <i>intention</i> can no longer be
doubtful in the smallest degree, as he has secured
the refusal of the house which Mr. Baverstock at
present occupies in Chawton, and is to vacate soon,
which is of course intended for Mrs. Elizabeth
Papillon.</p>

<p>Adieu, Amiable! I hope Caroline behaves well
to you.</p>

<div class='signature'>

<span class="smcap">J. Austen</span>.</div>
<p><small>J. E. Austen, Esq.</small>
</p></div>

<p>The same bright tone pervades the following
letter to Alethea Bigg, from which one of the remarks
quoted above, as to the improvement of her health,
is taken.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'><br />Chawton: January 24, 1817.
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Alethea</span>,&mdash;I think it time there should
be a little writing between us, though I believe the
epistolary debt is on <i>your</i> side, and I hope this will
find all the Streatham party well, neither carried
away by the flood, nor rheumatic through the damps.
Such mild weather is, you know, delightful to <i>us</i>,
and though we have a great many ponds, and a fine
running stream through the meadows on the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
side of the road, it is nothing but what beautifies us
and does to talk of.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>I</i> have certainly gained
strength through the winter and am not far from
being well; and I think I understand my own case
now so much better than I did, as to be able by
care to keep off any serious return of illness. I am
more and more convinced that <i>bile</i> is at the bottom
of all I have suffered, which makes it easy to
know how to treat myself. You .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. will be glad
to hear thus much of me, I am sure.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We
have just had a few days' visit from Edward,
who brought us a good account of his father, and
the very circumstance of his coming at all, of his
father's being able to spare him, is itself a good
account.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He grows still, and still improves in
appearance, at least in the estimation of his aunts,
who love him better and better, as they see the
sweet temper and warm affections of the boy confirmed
in the young man: I tried hard to persuade
him that he must have some message for William,<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>
but in vain.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This is not a time of year for
donkey-carriages, and our donkeys are necessarily
having so long a run of luxurious idleness that I
suppose we shall find they have forgotten much of
their education when we use them again. We do
not use two at once, however; don't imagine such
excesses.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Our own new clergyman<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> is expected
here very soon, perhaps in time to assist Mr. Papillon
on Sunday. I shall be very glad when the first
hearing is over. It will be a nervous hour for our
pew, though we hear that he acquits himself with as
much ease and collectedness, as if he had been used
to it all his life. We have no chance we know of
seeing you between Streatham and Winchester:
you go the other road and are engaged to two or
three houses; if there should be any change, however,
you know how welcome you would be.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<p>We have been reading the <i>Poet's Pilgrimage to
Waterloo</i>,<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> and generally with much approbation.
Nothing will please all the world, you know; but
parts of it suit me better than much that he has
written before. The opening&mdash;<i>the proem</i> I believe
he calls it&mdash;is very beautiful. Poor man! one cannot
but grieve for the loss of the son so fondly described.
Has he at all recovered it? What do Mr. and
Mrs. Hill know about his present state?</p>

<div class='signature'>
Yours aff<sup>ly</sup>,
<span class="smcap">J. Austen</span>.
</div>

<p>The real object of this letter is to ask you for a
receipt, but I thought it genteel not to let it appear
early. We remember some excellent orange wine at
Manydown, made from Seville oranges, entirely or
chiefly. I should be very much obliged to you for
the receipt, if you can command it within a few
weeks.</p></div>

<p>Three days later, Jane felt well enough to set to
work on a fresh novel: thoroughly fresh, for it bore
no resemblance to any of her previous stories. A
short <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of this beginning is given in the <i>Memoir</i>,
and from it the reader will see that the scene is laid
at a new watering-place,<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> which is being exploited
by two of the leading characters. In the twelve
chapters which she wrote, the <i>dramatis personae</i> are
sketched in with vigour and decision; but there is
little of the subtle refinement which we are accustomed
to associate with her work, and certainly
nothing of the tender sentiment of <i>Persuasion</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
It is unfair, however, to judge from the first draft
of a few introductory chapters, written as they no
doubt were to relieve the tedium of long hours of
confinement, and written perhaps also to comfort her
friends by letting them see that she was still able
to work. It is probable, too, that a long step in the
downward progress of her condition was taken in
the course of the seven weeks during which she was
writing for the last time. It began 'in her usual
firm and neat hand, but some of the latter pages were
first traced in pencil&mdash;probably, when she was too ill
to sit long at a desk&mdash;and afterwards written over in
ink."<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> The last date on the MS. is March 17. She
was, no doubt, by this time making frequent use of
the temporary couch, which, as we are told, she had
contrived out of two or three chairs, so as to leave
the one real sofa free for her mother. She professed
to like her own couch best; but the importunity of
a young niece obliged her to confess that she used
it always, because she thought that her mother
would not use the sofa enough unless it were
absolutely reserved for her service.</p>

<p>In February and March followed the three letters
written to Fanny Knight&mdash;portions of which are
given in the last chapter. They chiefly concern
Fanny's own affairs, and show how lively Jane's
mind still was, and with what unselfish care she could
divert it from her own sufferings to the concerns
which interested those nearest to her.</p>

<p>We now append the sentences in those letters
which refer to her own state of health, and which
certainly read as if some serious accession of illness
had intervened while the correspondence was in
progress.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>February 20, 1817.</i>&mdash;I am almost entirely cured of
my rheumatism&mdash;just a little pain in my knee, now and
then, to make me remember what it was and keep
on flannel. Aunt Cassandra nursed me so beautifully.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>March 13.</i>&mdash;I am got tolerably well again, quite
equal to walking about and enjoying the air, and
by sitting down and resting a good while between
my walks I get exercise enough. I have a scheme
however for accomplishing more, as the weather
grows spring-like. I mean to take to riding the
donkey; it will be more independent and less troublesome
than the use of the carriage, and I shall be able
to go about with Aunt Cassandra in her walks to
Alton and Wyards.</p>

<p><i>March 23.</i>&mdash;Many thanks for your kind care of
my health; I certainly have not been well for many
weeks, and about a week ago I was very poorly.
I have had a good deal of fever at times, and indifferent
nights; but I am considerably better now
and am recovering my looks a little, which have
been bad enough&mdash;black and white and every wrong
colour. I must not depend upon being ever very
blooming again. Sickness is a dangerous indulgence
at my time of life.</p>

<p><i>Evening.</i>&mdash;I was languid and dull and very bad
company when I wrote the above; I am better now,
to my own feelings at least, and wish I may be more
agreeable. We are going to have rain, and after
that very pleasant genial weather, which will exactly
do for me, as my saddle will then be completed, and
air and exercise is what I want.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;I took my first ride yesterday, and
liked it very much. I went up Mounter's Lane and
round by where the new cottages are to be, and
found the exercise and everything very pleasant;
and I had the advantage of agreeable companions,
as Aunt Cass and Edward walked by my side. Aunt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
Cass is such an excellent nurse, so assiduous and
unwearied! But you know all that already.</p></div>

<p>At the end of March she made her will&mdash;a brief
and simple document of which the operative part
was in these words: 'To my dearest sister Cassandra
Elizabeth, everything of which I may die possessed,
or which may hereafter be due to me, subject to the
payment of my funeral expenses and to a legacy of
&pound;50 to my brother Henry and &pound;50 to Madame Bigeon.'<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<p>About the same time another will was causing
great disappointment to the Austen family; and as
Jane was affected by anything that affected her
nearest relations, we must probably attribute to it
some share in the rapid decay of her bodily strength.</p>

<p>Her uncle, Mr. Leigh Perrot, died at Scarlets on
March 28. He was childless, and left a considerable
fortune. As he was also a kind-hearted man and
had always shown particular favour to the Austens,
it was reasonably expected that they would reap
some immediate benefit under his will. Most of the
family were in narrow circumstances, and they had
lately been crippled by the failure of Henry's business
and the lawsuit about Edward's Hampshire property;
a legacy, therefore, would have been very acceptable.
Mr. Leigh Perrot, however, was actuated in making
his will by a stronger motive than love to sister
and nephews.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> He was devoted to his wife, and
was perhaps anxious to show that his devotion was
increased in consequence of the false accusation with
which she had been assailed at Bath in 1799-1800.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
He showed it by leaving everything to her for her
life, and placing Scarlets and a considerable sum at
her free disposal. At the same time he left a large
sum (subject to her life interest) to James Austen
and his heirs, and &pound;1000 apiece to <i>each</i> of Mrs. Austen's
children who should survive his wife. Mrs. Leigh
Perrot, also, at a later date, gave allowances to some
members of the family, and eventually made Edward
Austen her heir. None of these advantages, however,
fell to them immediately; and the disappointment
caused by their uncle's disposition of his property
is reflected in the following letter from Jane to her
brother Charles.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'><br />[April 6, 1817.]
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dearest Charles</span>,&mdash;Many thanks for your
affectionate letter. I was in your debt before, but
I have really been too unwell the last fortnight to
write anything that was not absolutely necessary.
I have been suffering from a bilious attack attended
with a good deal of fever. A few days ago my complaint
appeared removed, but I am ashamed to say
that the shock of my uncle's will brought on a relapse,
and I was so ill on Friday and thought myself so
likely to be worse that I could not but press for
Cassandra's returning with Frank after the funeral
last night, which she of course did; and either her
return, or my having seen Mr. Curtis, or my disorder's
chusing to go away, have made me better
this morning. I live upstairs however for the present,
and am coddled. I am the only one of the legatees
who has been so silly, but a weak body must excuse
weak nerves.</p>

<p>My mother has borne the forgetfulness of <i>her</i>
extremely well&mdash;her expectations for herself were
never beyond the extreme of moderation, and she
thinks with you that my Uncle always looked forward
to surviving her. She desires her best love,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
and many thanks for your kind feelings; and heartily
wishes that her younger children had more, and all
her children something immediately.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Nothing can be kinder than Mrs. Cooke's enquiries
after you [and Harriet] in all her letters, and there was
no standing her affectionate way of speaking of <i>your</i>
countenance, after her seeing you. God bless you all.</p>

<p>Conclude me to be going on well if you hear nothing
to the contrary.</p>

<div class='signature'>
Yours ever truly,
J. A.
</div>

<p>Tell dear Harriet that whenever she wants me
in her service again she must send a hackney chariot
all the way for me&mdash;for I am not strong enough to
travel any other way, and I hope Cassy will take care
that it is a green one.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p></div>

<p>We will end this chapter with Caroline Austen's
account of her last visit to her Aunt Jane, which
occurred about this time.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It had been settled<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> that about the end of
March, or the beginning of April, I should spend
a few days at Chawton, in the absence of my
father and mother, who were just then engaged
with Mrs. Leigh Perrot in arranging her late husband's
affairs; but Aunt Jane became too ill to
have me in the house, and so I went instead to
my sister Mrs. Lefroy at Wyards. The next day
we walked over to Chawton to make enquiries after
our aunt. She was then keeping her room, but said
she would see us, and we went up to her. She was in
her dressing-gown, and was sitting quite like an invalid
in an arm-chair, but she got up and kindly greeted
us, and then, pointing to seats which had been arranged
for us by the fire, she said 'There is a chair for the
married lady, and a little stool for you, Caroline.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
It is strange, but those trifling words were the last of
hers that I can remember, for I retain no recollection
of what was said by anyone in the conversation that
ensued. I was struck by the alteration in herself.
She was very pale, her voice was weak and low, and
there was about her a general appearance of debility
and suffering; but I have been told that she never
had much acute pain. She was not equal to the
exertion of talking to us, and our visit to the sick
room was a very short one, Aunt Cassandra soon
taking us away. I do not suppose we stayed a
quarter of an hour; and I never saw Aunt Jane
again.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>WINCHESTER</h3>

<h3>1817</h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>Even</span> after the beginning of April, Jane's hopefulness
did not desert her. 'I am happy,' says James
Austen, writing to his daughter Anna, 'to give you
a good account, written by herself in a letter from
your Aunt Jane; but all who love&mdash;and that is all
who know her&mdash;must be anxious on her account.'</div>

<p>When May came, she consented to the proposal
of those around her that she should move to Winchester,
in order to get the best medical advice that
the neighbourhood afforded. The Lyford family had
maintained for some time a high character for skill
in the profession of medicine at that place; and the
Mr. Lyford of the day was a man of more than provincial
reputation, in whom great London consultants
expressed confidence.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> Accordingly, on Saturday,
May 24, she bade farewell to her mother and her home,
and her brother James's carriage conveyed Cassandra
and herself to Winchester. The little cavalcade&mdash;for
they were attended by two riders&mdash;started in
sadness and in rain; and all must have doubted
whether she would ever come back to Chawton.</p>

<p>She was going, however, to a place for which she
felt the veneration which all good Hampshire people
owe to their county town: a veneration shared by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
a good many Englishmen outside the limits of the
county.</p>

<p>The sisters took lodgings in College Street, in the
house next to what was then called 'Commoners,'
and is now the head master's house. On the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'fron'">front</ins>
wall of the little house where they lived there is now
a plaque commemorating the stay of Jane Austen.
Near to them, in the Close, were living their old
friends Mrs. Heathcote and Miss Bigg, who did all
they could to add to their comforts; while at the
school were their nephew, Charles Knight, and young
William Heathcote&mdash;either of whom they might
hope to see from time to time.</p>

<p>The course of the illness, and its fatal termination,
are shown pretty clearly in the letters which follow;
the most informing and the most pathetic of which
(next to her own) are the two written by Cassandra
to Fanny Knight after all was ended.</p>

<p>Some of the letters are undated, and we cannot
therefore be certain of the order in which they were
written; we must also allow for the probable fact
that Cassandra did not say more than was necessary
to her mother of Jane's increasing weakness and
discomfort.</p>

<p>Mr. Lyford spoke encouragingly, though it is
believed that he had, from the first, very little expectation
of a permanent cure. Some temporary
rally there seems to have been; and, soon after
settling in her lodgings, Jane was able to write as
follows to Edward Austen:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'><br /><span style="margin-right: 4em;">Mrs. David's, College Street, Winton:</span><br />
Tuesday [May 27, 1817].<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>
</div>

<p>I know no better way, my dearest Edward, of
thanking you for your most affectionate concern for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
me during my illness than by telling you myself, as
soon as possible, that I continue to get better. I will
not boast of my handwriting; neither that nor my
face have yet recovered their proper beauty, but in
other respects I am gaining strength very fast. I
am now out of bed from 9 in the morning to 10 at
night: upon the sopha, 'tis true, but I eat my meals
with aunt Cass in a rational way, and can employ
myself, and walk from one room to another. Mr.
Lyford says he will cure me, and if he fails, I shall draw
up a memorial and lay it before the Dean and Chapter,
and have no doubt of redress from that pious, learned,
and disinterested body. Our lodgings are very comfortable.
We have a neat little drawing-room with
a bow window overlooking Dr. Gabell's garden.
Thanks to the kindness of your father and mother
in sending me their carriage, my journey hither on
Saturday was performed with very little fatigue, and
had it been a fine day, I think I should have felt none;
but it distressed me to see uncle Henry and Wm.
Knight, who kindly attended us on horseback, riding
in the rain almost all the way. We expect a visit
from them to-morrow, and hope they will stay the
night; and on Thursday, which is Confirmation
and a holiday, we are to get Charles out to breakfast.
We have had but one visit yet from <i>him</i>, poor fellow,
as he is in sick-room, but he hopes to be out to-night.
We see Mrs. Heathcote every day, and William is
to call upon us soon. God bless you, my dear Edward.
If ever you are ill, may you be as tenderly nursed as
I have been. May the same blessed alleviations of
anxious, sympathising friends be yours: and may
you possess, as I dare say you will, the greatest blessing
of all in the consciousness of not being unworthy of
their love. <i>I</i> could not feel this.</p>

<div class='signature'>

J. A.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span></div>

<p>Had I not engaged to write to you, you would have
heard again from your Aunt Martha, as she charged
me to tell you with her best love.</p>

</div>

<p>The original of this letter, which is preserved,
bears sad testimony to the truth of her remark
about her handwriting. Some few days after this,
she must have written her last extant letter, quoted
in the short Memoir prefixed to the original edition
of <i>Northanger Abbey:</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>My attendant is encouraging, and talks of
making me quite well. I live chiefly on the sofa, but
am allowed to walk from one room to the other. I
have been out once in a Sedan-chair, and am to repeat
it, and be promoted to a wheel-chair as the weather
serves. On this subject I will only say further that
my dearest sister, my tender, watchful, indefatigable
nurse, has not been made ill by her exertions. As
to what I owe to her, and to the anxious affection of
all my beloved family on this occasion, I can only
cry over it, and pray to God to bless them more and
more.</p></div>

<p>Some allusion to the family disappointment about
the will probably followed, and she added: 'But I
am getting too near complaint. It has been the
appointment of God, however secondary causes may
have operated.'</p>

<p>Jane's mother could still indulge in the hope of
her amendment. In a note to Anna, she says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>You will be happy to hear that our accounts from
Winchester are very good. Our letter this morning,
which was written yesterday evening, says 'Jane has
had a better night than she has had for many weeks
and has been comfortable all day. Mr. Lyford says<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
he thinks better of her than he has ever done, though
he must still consider her in a precarious state.'</p></div>

<p>And, in another letter&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I had a very comfortable account of your Aunt
Jane this morning; she now sits up a little. Charles
Knight came this morning: he saw her yesterday,
and says she looks better and seem'd very cheerful.
She hoped to be well enough to see Mrs. Portal
to-day; your Mamma is there (went yesterday by
the coach), which I am very glad of. Cassandra did
not quite like the nurse they had got, so wish'd
Mrs. J. A. to come in her stead, as she promised she
would whenever she was wanted.</p></div>

<p>Mrs. James Austen went to Winchester on a
Friday; perhaps Friday, June 6. Two or three days
afterwards, her husband wrote to their son Edward,
who no doubt was following at Oxford with painful
interest the varying news. James, at any rate,
cherished no illusions as to the possibility of a
cure.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'><br />Steventon: Thursday.
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Edward</span>,&mdash;I grieve to write what you
will grieve to read; but I must tell you that we can
no longer flatter ourselves with the least hope of
having your dear valuable Aunt Jane restored to us.
The symptoms which returned after the first four or
five days at Winchester, have never subsided, and
Mr. Lyford has candidly told us that her case is
desperate. I need not say what a melancholy gloom
this has cast over us all. Your Grandmamma has
suffered much, but her affliction can be nothing to
Cassandra's. She will indeed be to be pitied. It
is some consolation to know that our poor invalid
has hitherto felt no very severe pain&mdash;which is rather
an extraordinary circumstance in her complaint.
I saw her on Tuesday and found her much altered,
but composed and cheerful. She is well aware of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
her situation. Your Mother has been there ever
since Friday and returns not till all is over&mdash;how
soon that may be we cannot say&mdash;Lyford said he
saw no signs of immediate dissolution, but added
that with such a pulse it was impossible for any
person to last long, and indeed no one can wish it&mdash;an
easy departure from this to a better world is
all that we can pray for. I am going to Winchester
again to-morrow; you may depend upon early information,
when any change takes place, and should
then prepare yourself for what the next letter <i>may</i>
announce.</p>

<p>Mrs. Heathcote is the greatest possible comfort to
them all.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>We all join in love.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Your affectionate Father,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">J. Austen</span>.
</div></div>

<p>Edward's young sister Caroline (aged twelve) adds
a few unhappy lines about her aunt, saying: 'I now
feel as if I had never loved and valued her enough.'</p>

<p>Jane Austen 'retained her faculties, her memory,
her fancy, her temper, and her affections&mdash;warm,
clear, and unimpaired to the last. Neither her love
of God, nor of her fellow-creatures flagged for a
moment.'<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> Her two clergyman brothers were near
at hand to administer the consolations of religion,
and she made a point of receiving the Holy Communion
while she was still strong enough to follow
the Service with full attention.</p>

<p>'While she used the language of hope to her
correspondents, she was fully aware of her danger,
though not appalled by it.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> It is true that there
was much to attach her to life. She was happy in
her family; she was just beginning to feel confidence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
in her own success; and, no doubt, the exercise of
her great talents was an enjoyment in itself. We
may well believe that she would gladly have lived
longer; but she was enabled without dismay or
complaint to prepare for death. She was a humble,
believing Christian. Her life had been passed in
the performance of home duties, and the cultivation
of domestic affections, without any self-seeking or
craving after applause. She had always sought, as
it were by instinct, to promote the happiness of all
who came within her influence, and doubtless she
had her reward in the peace of mind which was
granted her in her last days. Her sweetness of
temper never failed. She was ever considerate and
grateful to those who attended on her. At times,
when she felt rather better, her playfulness of spirit
revived, and she amused them even in their sadness.
Once, when she thought herself near her end, she said
what she imagined might be her last words to those
around her, and particularly thanked her sister-in-law
for being with her, saying: "You have always
been a kind sister to me, Mary."'</p>

<p>She wrote whilst she could hold a pen, and with
a pencil when a pen had become too laborious. Even
a day or two before her death she was able to compose
some light verses on St. Swithin, Winchester
Races, and the weather. But the record of the last
sad hours and of her death in the early morning of
Friday, July 18, will be best read in the letter of
Cassandra to Fanny Knight.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'>Winchester: Sunday [July 20, 1817].<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dearest Fanny</span>,&mdash;Doubly dear to me now
for her dear sake whom we have lost. She did love<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
you most sincerely, and never shall I forget the proofs
of love you gave her during her illness in writing
those kind, amusing letters at a time when I know
your feelings would have dictated so different a style.
Take the only reward I can give you in the assurance
that your benevolent purpose <i>was</i> answered; you <i>did</i>
contribute to her enjoyment.</p>

<p>Even your last letter afforded pleasure. I merely
cut the seal and gave it to her; she opened it and
read it herself, afterwards she gave it me to read,
and then talked to me a little and not uncheerfully
of its contents, but there was then a languor about
her which prevented her taking the same interest in
anything she had been used to do.</p>

<p>Since Tuesday evening, when her complaint
returned, there was a visible change, she slept more
and much more comfortably; indeed, during the
last eight-and-forty hours she was more asleep than
awake. Her looks altered and she fell away, but I
perceived no material diminution of strength, and,
though I was then hopeless of a recovery, I had no
suspicion how rapidly my loss was approaching.</p>

<p>I <i>have</i> lost a treasure, such a sister, such a friend
as never can have been surpassed. She was the sun
of my life, the gilder of every pleasure, the soother
of every sorrow; I had not a thought concealed from
her, and it is as if I had lost a part of myself. I
loved her only too well&mdash;not better than she deserved,
but I am conscious that my affection for her made
me sometimes unjust to and negligent of others; and
I can acknowledge, more than as a general principle,
the justice of the Hand which has struck this blow.</p>

<p>You know me too well to be at all afraid that
I should suffer materially from my feelings; I am
perfectly conscious of the extent of my irreparable
loss, but I am not at all overpowered and very little
indisposed, nothing but what a short time, with rest
and change of air, will remove. I thank God that
I was enabled to attend her to the last, and amongst<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
my many causes of self-reproach I have not to add
any wilful neglect of her comfort.</p>

<p>She felt herself to be dying about half an hour
before she became tranquil and apparently unconscious.
During that half-hour was her struggle,
poor soul! She said she could not tell us what she
suffered, though she complained of little fixed pain.
When I asked her if there was anything she wanted,
her answer was she wanted nothing but death, and
some of her words were: 'God grant me patience,
pray for me, oh, pray for me!' Her voice was
affected, but as long as she spoke she was intelligible.</p>

<p>I hope I do not break your heart, my dearest
Fanny, by these particulars; I mean to afford you
gratification whilst I am relieving my own feelings.
I could not write so to anybody else; indeed you are
the only person I have written to at all, excepting
your grandmamma&mdash;it was to her, not your Uncle
Charles, I wrote on Friday.</p>

<p>Immediately after dinner on Thursday I went
into the town to do an errand which your dear aunt
was anxious about. I returned about a quarter
before six and found her recovering from faintness
and oppression; she got so well as to be able to give
me a minute account of her seizure, and when the
clock struck six she was talking quietly to me.</p>

<p>I cannot say how soon afterwards she was seized
again with the same faintness, which was followed
by the sufferings she could not describe; but Mr.
Lyford had been sent for, had applied something to
give her ease, and she was in a state of quiet insensibility
by seven o'clock at the latest. From that time
till half-past four, when she ceased to breathe, she
scarcely moved a limb, so that we have every reason
to think, with gratitude to the Almighty, that her
sufferings were over. A slight motion of the head
with every breath remained till almost the last.
I sat close to her with a pillow in my lap to assist in
supporting her head, which was almost off the bed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
for six hours; fatigue made me then resign my
place to Mrs. J. A. for two hours and a half, when
I took it again, and in about an hour more she
breathed her last.</p>

<p>I was able to close her eyes myself, and it was
a great gratification to me to render her those last
services. There was nothing convulsed which gave
the idea of pain in her look; on the contrary, but
for the continual motion of the head, she gave one
the idea of a beautiful statue, and even now, in her
coffin, there is such a sweet, serene air over her
countenance as is quite pleasant to contemplate.</p>

<p>This day, my dearest Fanny, you have had the
melancholy intelligence, and I know you suffer
severely, but I likewise know that you will apply
to the fountain-head for consolation, and that our
merciful God is never deaf to such prayers as you
will offer.</p>

<p>The last sad ceremony is to take place on Thursday
morning; her dear remains are to be deposited in
the Cathedral. It is a satisfaction to me to think
that they are to lie in a building she admired so
much; her precious soul, I presume to hope, reposes
in a far superior mansion. May mine one day be
re-united to it!</p>

<p>Your dear papa, your Uncle Henry, and Frank,
and Edwd. Austen instead of his father, will attend.
I hope they will none of them suffer lastingly from
their pious exertions. The ceremony must be over
before ten o'clock, as the Cathedral service begins
at that hour, so that we shall be at home early
in the day, for there will be nothing to keep us
here afterwards.</p>

<p>Your Uncle James came to us yesterday, and is
gone home to-day. Uncle H. goes to Chawton to-morrow
morning; he has given every necessary
direction here, and I think his company there will
do good. He returns to us again on Tuesday
evening.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span></p>

<p>I did not think to have written a long letter
when I began, but I have found the employment
draw me on, and I hope I shall have been giving you
more pleasure than pain. Remember me kindly to
Mrs. J. Bridges (I am so glad she is with you now),
and give my best love to Lizzie and all the others.</p>

<div class='signature'>
I am, my dearest Fanny,
Most affectionately yours,
<span class="smcap">Cass. Eliz. Austen</span>.
</div>

<p>I have said nothing about those at Chawton,
because I am sure you hear from your papa.</p></div>

<p>During these sad days, Anna Lefroy had written
to her grandmother at Chawton, offering to go to
her. Mrs. Austen answered:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I thank you sincerely for all your kind expressions,
and your offer. I am certainly in a good
deal of affliction, but trust God will support me.
I was not prepared for the blow, though it in a
manner hung over us; I had reason to think it
at a distance, and was not quite without hope that
she might in part recover. After a few months'
illness she may be said to have died suddenly.
Mr. Lyford supposed a large blood-vessel had given
way. I hope her sufferings were not severe&mdash;they
were not long. I had a letter from Cassandra this
morning. She is in great affliction, but bears it like
a Christian. Dear Jane is to be buried in the
Cathedral, I believe on Thursday&mdash;in which case
Cassandra will come home as soon as it is over.</p></div>

<p>Cassandra did go home, and a few days later wrote
again to Fanny Knight as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'><br />Chawton: Tuesday [July 29, 1817].<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My dearest Fanny</span>,&mdash;I have just read your
letter for the third time, and thank you most sincerely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
for every kind expression to myself, and still more
warmly for your praises of her who I believe was
better known to you than to any human being
besides myself. Nothing of the sort could have been
more gratifying to me than the manner in which you
write of her, and if the dear angel is conscious of
what passes here, and is not above all earthly feelings,
she may perhaps receive pleasure in being so mourned.
Had <i>she</i> been the survivor I can fancy her speaking
of <i>you</i> in almost the same terms. There are certainly
many points of strong resemblance in your characters;
in your intimate acquaintance with each other, and
your mutual strong affection, you were counterparts.</p>

<p>Thursday was not so dreadful a day to me as
you imagined. There was so much necessary to be
done that there was no time for additional misery.
Everything was conducted with the greatest tranquillity,
and but that I was determined I would see
the last, and therefore was upon the listen, I should
not have known when they left the house. I watched
the little mournful procession the length of the
street; and when it turned from my sight, and I
had lost her for ever, even then I was not overpowered,
nor so much agitated as I am now in writing
of it. Never was human being more sincerely
mourned by those who attended her remains than
was this dear creature. May the sorrow with which
she is parted with on earth be a prognostic of the joy
with which she is hailed in heaven!</p>

<p>I continue very tolerably well&mdash;much better
than any one could have supposed possible, because
I certainly have had considerable fatigue of body
as well as anguish of mind for months back; but
I really am well, and I hope I am properly grateful
to the Almighty for having been so supported.
Your grandmamma, too, is much better than when
I came home.</p>

<p>I did not think your dear papa appeared unwell,
and I understand that he seemed much more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
comfortable after his return from Winchester than he
had done before. I need not tell you that he was a
great comfort to me; indeed, I can never say enough
of the kindness I have received from him and from
every other friend.</p>

<p>I get out of doors a good deal and am able to
employ myself. Of course those employments suit
me best which leave me most at leisure to think of
her I have lost, and I do think of her in every variety
of circumstance. In our happy hours of confidential
intercourse, in the cheerful family party which she
so ornamented, in her sick room, on her death-bed,
and as (I hope) an inhabitant of heaven. Oh, if I
may one day be re-united to her there! I know the
time must come when my mind will be less engrossed
by her idea, but I do not like to think of it. If I
think of her less as on earth, God grant that I may
never cease to reflect on her as inhabiting heaven,
and never cease my humble endeavours (when it
shall please God) to join her there.</p>

<p>In looking at a few of the precious papers which
are now my property I have found some memorandums,
amongst which she desires that one of her
gold chains may be given to her god-daughter Louisa,
and a lock of her hair be set for you. You can need
no assurance, my dearest Fanny, that every request
of your beloved aunt will be sacred with me. Be
so good as to say whether you prefer a brooch or
ring. God bless you, my dearest Fanny.</p>

<div class='signature'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Believe me, most affectionately yours,</span><br />
<br /><span class="smcap">Cass. Elizth. Austen</span>.
</div></div>

<p>So ends the story of Jane Austen's life. We can
only hope that we have succeeded in conveying to
the reader even a small part of the feeling which we
ourselves entertain of the charm of her personality&mdash;a
charm almost as remarkable in its way as the
brightness of her genius. In one respect it is easy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
to write about her&mdash;there is nothing to conceal.
Some readers may perhaps add 'There is little to
tell'; and it is true that, though the want of incident
in her life has often been exaggerated, her occupations
were largely those of helpfulness and sympathy
towards others whose lot was more variable than
hers, and the development of her own powers to be
the delight of generations of readers.</p>

<p>But this position gave her quite sufficient opportunity
of showing her character&mdash;and it is a character
which it is a continual pleasure to contemplate. Her
perfect balance and good sense did not diminish her
liveliness. Her intellectual qualities did not prevent
the enjoyment of a dance, or attention to the most
domestic duties. Her consciousness of genius left
room for a belief that Cassandra was wiser and
better than herself. Her keen and humorous
observation of the frailties of mankind was compatible
with indulgence towards the faults of her
neighbours. Her growing fame did not make her
the less accessible and delightful to her nieces, who
could consult their aunt and obtain a willing listener
in any difficulty whatever, from a doubtful love
affair to the working of a sampler. Indeed, she is
a standing witness to the truth that eccentricity and
self-consciousness are not essential parts of genius.</p>

<p>When her body had been laid in Winchester
Cathedral, the small band of mourners went back in
sadness to their different homes. They were very
fond and very proud of her; and each, we are told,
loved afterwards to fancy a resemblance in some
niece or daughter of their own to the dear sister Jane,
whose perfect equal they yet never expected to see.</p>

<p>Cassandra returned to Chawton and devoted a
further ten years to the care of her aged mother.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
Till old Mrs. Austen's death in 1827, Martha Lloyd
remained an inmate, and everything went on, nominally,
as before; but the 'chief light was quenched
and the loss of it had cast a shade over the spirits
of the survivors.'<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> So, when the young Austens
went to stay there, expecting to be particularly happy,
they could not help feeling something of the chill of
disappointment. Later, Martha became the second
wife of Francis Austen, while Cassandra lived on at
Chawton. One of her great-nieces remembers seeing
her towards the end of her life at a christening, 'a
pale, dark-eyed old lady, with a high arched nose and
a kind smile, dressed in a long cloak and a large
drawn bonnet, both made of black satin.' She died
of a sudden illness in 1845, at the house of her
brother Francis, near Portsmouth&mdash;at his house, but
in his absence; for he and his family had to leave
for the West Indies (where he was to take up a
command) while she lay dying. She was tended
by her brothers Henry and Charles and her niece
Caroline. She was buried beside her mother at
Chawton.</p>

<p>All her brothers survived her, except James, who
was in bad health when his sister Jane died, and
followed her in 1819.</p>

<p>Edward (Knight) saw his children and his children's
children grow up around him, and died at
Godmersham as peacefully as he had lived, in 1852.</p>

<p>Henry held the living of Steventon for three
years after the death of his brother James, till his
nephew, William Knight, was ready to take it. He
was afterwards Perpetual Curate of Bentley, near
Farnham. Later on, he lived for some time in
France, and he died at Tunbridge Wells in 1850.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span></p>
<p>Both the sailor brothers rose to be Admirals.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>
Charles was employed in the suppression of the
Slave Trade and against Mehemet Ali, and became
Rear-Admiral in 1846. In 1850 he commanded in
the East Indian and Chinese waters, and died of
cholera on the Irawaddy River in 1852, having 'won
the hearts of all by his gentleness and kindness
whilst he was struggling with disease.'</p>

<p>Francis had thirty years on shore after the end
of the long war; and his only subsequent foreign
service was the command of the West Indian and
North American Station, 1845-48. He, however,
constantly rose in his profession, and enjoyed the
esteem and respect of the Admiralty. He ended by
being G.C.B. and Admiral of the Fleet, and did not
die until 1865, aged ninety-one.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Shortly before the end of her life, Jane Austen
wrote on a slip of paper:&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>Profits of my novels, over and above the &pound;600 in the
Navy Fives.</div>

<p><i>Northanger Abbey</i> and <i>Persuasion</i> were published
in four volumes by John Murray in 1818, and
to the former was prefixed a short biographical
notice of the author from the pen of Henry Austen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
In 1832 Mr. Bentley bought the copyright of all
the novels, except <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> (which Jane
Austen had sold outright to Mr. Egerton), from
Henry and Cassandra Austen, the joint proprietors,
for the sum of two hundred and fifty pounds.
Mr. Bentley must also have bought from Mr. Egerton's
executors the copyright of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>,
for he proceeded to issue a complete edition of the
novels with a biographical notice (also by Henry)
containing a few extra facts not mentioned in the
original edition of <i>Northanger Abbey</i>.</p>

<p>(James) Edward Austen, who added 'Leigh' to
his name on succeeding to the property of Scarlets
in 1836, wrote (in 1869-70) the <i>Memoir</i> of his aunt
which has been so often used in these pages, and
which, as the work of three eyewitnesses,<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> enjoys
an authority greater than that of any other account
of her. Its publication coincided with the beginning
of a great advance in her fame, and we think
it may be claimed that it was an important contributory
cause of that advance. Before that date,
an appreciation of her genius was rather the special
possession of small literary circles and individual
families; since that date it has been widely spread
both in England and in America. From her death
to 1870, there was only one complete edition of her
works, and nothing, except a few articles and reviews,
was written about her. Since 1870, editions, lives,
memoirs, &amp;c., have been almost too numerous to
count. We, who are adding to this stream of writings,
cannot induce ourselves to believe that the interest
of the public is yet exhausted.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX</h2>

<h3><i>The Text of Jane Austen's Novels.</i></h3>


<div class='unindent'><span class='smcap'>In</span> the course of frequent reprinting, various errors have
crept into the text of the novels, which seem in danger of
becoming perpetuated. We therefore make no apology for
pointing these out and for giving our reasons why we prefer
any particular reading.</div>

<p>In arriving at the correct text of Jane Austen, common
sense will be our best guide. It is of no use to assume,
as some editors have done, that the latest edition which
appeared in the author's lifetime, and which might naturally
have had the benefit of her corrections, is any more
correct than the earliest. Jane Austen was no skilled proofreader,
and it is a melancholy fact that the second edition
of <i>Mansfield Park</i>, which she returned to Mr. Murray 'as ready
for press' as she could make it, contains more misprints than
any of the other novels, including one or two that do not
appear in the first edition. But as the type was evidently
re-set, this may have been as much the printer's fault as the
author's. Again, though in one of her letters she points out
a misprint in the first edition of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, the
passage is not corrected in either the second or third edition,
both of which subsequently appeared in her lifetime.</p>

<p>Before noticing the various discrepancies, it is necessary
to say a few words about the chief editions of note.
During the author's lifetime three editions appeared of
<i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, two of <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> and of
<i>Mansfield Park</i>, and one of <i>Emma</i>. <i>Northanger Abbey</i>
and <i>Persuasion</i> were published soon after her death. No<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
other edition of the novels seems to have been published
until Bentley bought up the copyrights of all the novels
in 1832, and included them in his 'Standard Novels'
series.</p>

<p>In process of time, Bentley's edition adopted various
emendations in the text. It held the field to all intents and
purposes for sixty years (apart from cheap reprints in the
'Parlour Series,' 'Railway Library,' &amp;c.), and its text has
largely been followed in later editions, especially by Messrs.
Macmillan in their 'Pocket Classics' series. Other recent
editions, containing a more or less independent text&mdash;arrived
at by following the earliest editions&mdash;are those edited for
Messrs. Dent by Mr. Brimley Johnson, the earliest of which
appeared in 1892, and the most recent of which has appeared
in 'Everyman's Library'; the Hampshire Edition (<i>published</i>
by Mr. Brimley Johnson, but differing considerably from
the editions which he has <i>edited</i>); and the Winchester
Edition, published by Mr. Grant Richards.</p>

<p>Finally, with regard to textual criticism, we have an article
'On the printing of Jane Austen's novels,' by the late Dr.
Verrall, contributed to the <i>Cambridge Observer</i>, about 1892;
and two others, also by Dr. Verrall, 'On some passages in
Jane Austen's <i>Mansfield Park</i>,' in the <i>Cambridge Review</i>, for
November 30 and December 7, 1893; and certain emendations
pointed out in a review of a new edition of <i>Pride and
Prejudice</i> in the <i>Saturday Review</i> of November 12, 1910.</p>


<div class='center'><br />'<span class="smcap">Sense and Sensibility</span>'</div>

<p>In this novel scarcely anything calls for notice. The main
divergencies seem to be that the editions are divided between
reading 'such happiness' and 'such an happiness,' at the end
of Chapter <span class="smcap">iii</span>; between 'by all who called themselves her
friends' and 'by all who call themselves her friends,' in
Chapter <span class="smcap">xxxii</span>; and 'one of the happiest couples' or 'one of
the happiest couple,' in Chapter <span class="smcap">l</span>.</p>

<p>Johnson's 1892 edition has an unfortunate blunder at the
beginning of Chapter <span class="smcap">xxxii</span>: reading 'their effect on her was
entirely such as the former had hoped to see,' instead of 'their
effect on her was not entirely,' <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>&amp;c.</p>


<div class='center'><br />'<span class="smcap">Pride and Prejudice</span>'</div>

<p>1. The first passage that we consider to be frequently
misprinted is in Chapter <span class="smcap">iii</span>, where Mrs. Bennet is giving her
husband an account of the Meryton assembly, and of Mr.
Bingley's partners. The first three editions, followed by
Mr. Johnson, the Winchester and Hampshire Editions, print
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Then the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth
with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two
sixth with Lizzie and the Boulanger.'</p>

<p>'If he had had any compassion for me,' cried her husband
impatiently, 'he would not have danced half so much! For God's
sake, say no more of his partners. O that he had sprained his ankle
in the first dance!'</p>

<p>'Oh! my dear,' continued Mrs. Bennet, 'I am quite delighted
with him. He is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are
charming women. I never in my life saw anything more elegant
than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst's gown&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against
any description of finery, &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>Now, here there can be little doubt that we should read,
as in Bentley's edition,<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> 'and the two sixth with Lizzie, and
the <i>Boulanger</i>&mdash;&mdash;' (i.e. Bingley danced the <i>Boulanger</i> with
another partner, whose name Mrs. Bennet would have
given but for her husband interrupting her). In the first
place, there is every reason to suppose that Mr. Bingley danced
no more than 'the two sixth' (each dance seems to have
been divided into two parts, but without any change of
partners) with Lizzie, for Mrs. Bennet has already said that
Jane 'was the only creature in the room that he asked a
second time.' Secondly, the reading of the first edition
destroys the point of 'Here she was interrupted again.'</p>

<p>2. The next passage which is frequently misprinted is in
Chapter <span class="smcap">xix</span>, where Mr. Collins in the course of his proposal
to Elizabeth quotes the advice of his very noble patroness.
Bentley's edition here reads:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Mr. Collins, you must marry. A clergyman like you must
marry&mdash;&mdash; Choose properly, choose a gentlewoman for my sake, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
for your own; let her be an active, useful sort of person not brought
up high, but able to make a small income go a good way.'</p></div>

<p>By transposing a comma and a semicolon, the printer has
here succeeded in perverting a most characteristic bit of
advice of Lady Catherine's. The first three editions, followed
by Mr. Johnson; all read 'Choose properly, choose a gentlewoman
for my sake; and for your own, let her be an active,
useful sort of person,' &amp;c., and there can hardly be two
opinions as to which reading is the right one.</p>

<p>3. In Chapter <span class="smcap">xxxvi</span>, where Elizabeth is reviewing her
conduct towards Darcy, Bentley's edition, following the first
and second editions, makes her exclaim:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'How despicably have I acted,' she cried; 'I, who have prided
myself on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my
abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my
sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameless distrust.'</p></div>

<p>'Blameless' makes little or no sense, and we should surely
follow the third edition, which gives 'blameable.'</p>

<p>4. Chapter <span class="smcap">xxxviii</span>, when Elizabeth Bennet and Maria
Lucas are leaving Hunsford Parsonage, Mr. Brimley Johnson
in his edition of 1892, following the first and second editions,
arranges the sentences as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Good gracious!' cried Maria, after a few minutes' silence, 'it
seems but a day or two since we first came!&mdash;and yet how many
things have happened!'</p>

<p>'A great many indeed,' said her companion with a sigh. 'We
have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!
How much I shall have to tell!'</p>

<p>Elizabeth privately added, 'And how much I shall have to
conceal!'</p></div>

<p>The effect of this is to give the extremely banal remark
about dining and drinking tea at Rosings to Elizabeth instead
of to Maria. The third edition, followed by all the others,
gives the correct arrangement:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'A great many indeed,' said her companion with a sigh.</p>

<p>'We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there
twice! How much I shall have to tell!'</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span></p>

<p>5. In Chapter <span class="smcap">l</span>, where Mrs. Bennet is discussing the
various houses in the neighbourhood which might suit
Wickham and Lydia, Mr. Bennet is made in Bentley's and
all subsequent editions to remark:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Mrs. Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your
son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into <i>one</i>
house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I
will not encourage the imprudence of either, by receiving them at
Longbourn.'</p></div>

<p>Now 'imprudence' seems distinctly below Mr. Bennet's
usual form, and we should obviously follow the first and second
editions and read 'impudence.' Compare the sentence in
Chapter <span class="smcap">lvii</span>, where Mr. Bennet, talking of Mr. Collins's
correspondence, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'When I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the
preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and
hypocrisy of my son-in-law.'</p></div>

<p>It is the third edition that has here gone astray and misled
all the others.</p>

<p>6. Chapter <span class="smcap">liv</span>, when Bingley and Darcy have been dining
at Longbourn, we read in Mr. Johnson's edition, as well as
in the Hampshire and Winchester Editions:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would
have answered her hopes; but alas! the ladies had crowded round
the table, where Miss Bennet was taking tea, and Elizabeth pouring
out the coffee.</p></div>

<p>This is an ingenious little misprint; for what Miss Bennet,
who was one of the hostesses, was doing was not <i>taking</i> tea,
of course, but <i>making</i> tea. The early editions and Bentley
all read 'making.'</p>

<p>7. Chapter <span class="smcap">liv</span>, where Jane is trying to persuade Elizabeth
that she is in no danger of falling in love with Bingley again,
Bentley's edition reads:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'You are very cruel,' said her sister [i.e. Elizabeth], 'you will not
let me smile, and are provoking me to it every moment.'</p>

<p>'How hard it is in some cases to be believed! And how impossible
in others! But why should you wish to persuade me that I
feel more than I acknowledge?'</p>

<p>'That is a question which I hardly know how to answer.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span></p></div>

<p>Now, if we turn to the first three editions, we find the
passage broken up as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'You are very cruel,' said her sister, 'you will not let me smile,
and are provoking me to it every moment.'</p>

<p>'How hard it is in some cases to be believed! And how impossible
in others!'</p>

<p>'But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than
I acknowledge?'</p>

<p>'That is a question which I hardly know how to answer.'</p></div>

<p>This is the only passage which we can correct on the
authority of the author herself. In a letter dated February 4,
1813, she says, referring to the first edition of <i>Pride and
Prejudice:</i> 'The greatest blunder in printing is in p. 220,
l. 3, where two sentences are made into one.' Unfortunately,
in trying to correct the mistake, Bentley's edition
fell into another, and Mr. Johnson was the first to break
up the sentences correctly. The passage should of course
run:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'You are very cruel,' said her sister, 'you will not let me smile,
and are provoking me to it every moment.'</p>

<p>'How hard it is in some cases to be believed!'</p>

<p>'And how impossible in others!'</p>

<p>'But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than
I acknowledge?'</p>

<p>'That is a question which I hardly know how to answer.'</p></div>

<p>8. Chapter <span class="smcap">lv</span>, when Jane's engagement to Bingley had
been arranged, Bentley's edition, following the third edition,
reads:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and
ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them
so many previous months of surprise and vexation.</p></div>

<p>'Surprise' does not seem nearly so suitable a word as
'suspense,' which is found in the first and second editions.</p>

<p>9. Chapter <span class="smcap">lv</span>, where Jane is talking to Elizabeth about
Bingley. Mr. Johnson's editions, following the first three
editions, read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Would you believe it, Lizzie, that when he went to town last
November, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of my
being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again!'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span></p>

<p>'He made a little mistake, to be sure; but it is to the credit of his
modesty.'</p>

<p>This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence,
and the little value he put on his own good qualities.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the
interference of his friends; for, though Jane had the most generous
and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance
which must prejudice her against him.</p></div>

<p>As this last paragraph stands, 'him' can hardly refer to
anyone else but Bingley, which makes nonsense. Nothing
was likely to prejudice Jane against him; besides, it was not
his 'friends' who had interfered, but his 'friend' Darcy.
There can be no doubt, therefore, that we ought to read,
with Bentley's edition, 'friend,' and then 'him' will refer to
Darcy, against whom Lizzie was very anxious on her own
account that Jane should not be prejudiced.</p>

<p>10. Chapter <span class="smcap">lvi</span>, when Lady Catherine is trying to browbeat
Elizabeth, Mr. Johnson reads, in his edition of 1892,
following the first two editions (which, however, have a
comma after 'accomplished'):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'While in their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the
moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in
their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth,
of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family?'</p></div>

<p>Most editions, however, following the third, merely alter
the interrogation to an exclamation mark; but it is by no
means certain that we ought not to read '<i>is</i> their marriage'
instead of '<i>in</i> their marriage,' placing the comma three words
earlier: then we can keep the interrogation. So the edition
published by George Allen in 1894.</p>


<div class='center'><br />'<span class="smcap">Mansfield Park</span>'</div>

<p>1. Chapter <span class="smcap">viii</span>: Bentley's edition, following the first
and second editions, reads:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Mrs. Rushworth proceeded next, under the conviction that
everybody must be wanting to see Sotherton, to include Miss Crawford
in the invitation; and though Miss Grant, who had not been at
the trouble of visiting Mrs. Rushworth, on her coming into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
neighbourhood, civilly declined it on her own account, she was glad
to secure any pleasure for her sister; and Mary, properly pressed
and persuaded, was not long in accepting her share of the civility.</p></div>

<p>Inasmuch as there is no such character as 'Miss Grant' in
the book, all other editions read 'Mrs. Grant.' Dr. Verrall,
in the pages of the <i>Cambridge Review</i>, defended 'Miss Grant,'
provided that 'Miss' were placed between inverted commas,
as well as the previous 'Miss Crawford'; he believed Mrs.
Rushworth to have been a blundering kind of person, who
desired to invite Miss Crawford, but while naming 'Miss
Crawford' addressed herself to Mrs. Grant. Otherwise (if
we read 'Mrs. Grant'), Dr. Verrall argued, there was not the
slightest occasion for Mrs. Grant to decline the invitation
on her own account, for she had not been in any way invited;
nor would there have been any need for Mary to be 'properly
pressed and persuaded,' and then to accept 'her share' of
the civility. Dr. Verrall's suggestion is ingenious, but not
quite convincing.</p>

<p>2. Chapter <span class="smcap">viii</span>: Bentley's edition, following the first and
second editions, reads:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>When Edmund, therefore, told her in reply, as he did when she
would give him the hearing, that she need not distress herself on
Mrs. Rushworth's account, because he had taken the opportunity,
as he walked with her through the hall, of mentioning Miss Price as
one who would probably be of the party, and had directly received a
very sufficient invitation for her cousin, &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>'<i>Her</i> cousin' would certainly seem to be a mistake; and
all other editions accordingly alter 'her' to 'his.' Dr. Verrall,
however, defends 'her'; and would read 'and had directly
received a very sufficient invitation for her cousin,' on the
ground that Mrs. Rushworth, not quite understanding who
was meant by Miss Price, thought she was cousin to the Miss
Price who she had previously heard would remain at home
with Lady Bertram. Some such explanation, Dr. Verrall
thought, would alone account for the 'very sufficient'
invitation.</p>

<p>3. Chapter <span class="smcap">x</span>, p. 106, where Fanny Price says to Mr.
Rushworth, who on returning with the key finds Miss Bertram<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
and Mr. Crawford have gone into the park without waiting
for him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'They desired me to stay&mdash;my cousin Maria charged me to
say that you would find them at that knoll, or thereabouts.'</p></div>

<p>So all the editions read; but Dr. Verrall would emend to
'They desired me to say&mdash;my cousin,' &amp;c., on the ground
that Fanny, who was the soul of truth, had not been desired
to stay. But, for the matter of that, neither had her cousin
Maria charged her to say anything, for it was Crawford who
had suggested that 'Miss Price will be so good as to tell him,
that he will find us near that knoll.' However, the emendation
is attractive, as it shows Fanny trying to make the best case
she can for Maria by eliminating Crawford's share in the
transaction.</p>

<p>4. Chapter <span class="smcap">xxiv</span>: All editions read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This dear William would soon be amongst them. There could be
no doubt of his obtaining leave of absence immediately, for he was
still only a midshipman; and as his parents, from living on the spot,
must already have seen him and be seeing him perhaps daily, his
direct holidays might with justice be instantly given to his sister.</p></div>

<p>The expression 'his direct holidays,' meaning 'his actual
holidays,' is intelligible enough, but did not satisfy Dr. Verrall,
who suggested 'derelict' as a naval expression to imply
holidays on which no one had a claim, and which might
therefore be given to Mansfield Park. Like many of Dr.
Verrall's emendations, its ingenuity is greater than its
probability.</p>

<p>5. Chapter <span class="smcap">xxxiii</span>, p. 340:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Here again was a something of the same Mr. Crawford whom she
had so reprobated before. How evidently was there a gross want of
feeling and humanity where his own pleasure was concerned; and
alas! how always known no principle to supply as a duty what the
heart was deficient in.</p></div>

<p>It is difficult to believe that Jane Austen can have written
anything so clumsy as 'how always known no principle.'
Such, however, is the reading of all the editions, except the
Hampshire Edition, which, without giving any note, violently
emends to 'how lacking the principle.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span></p>

<p>6. Chapter <span class="smcap">xxxix</span>: Bentley, following the second edition,
reads:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Her days were spent in a kind of slow bustle; all was busy
without getting on, always behind hand and lamenting it, without
altering her ways; wishing to be an economist, without contrivance
or regularity; dissatisfied with her servants, without skill to make
them better, and whether helping or reprimanding, or indulging
them, without any power of engaging their respect.</p></div>

<p>Here the printer has been most ingenious. The text should,
of course, be 'always busy,' as it is in the first edition and
the Hampshire Edition.</p>

<p>7. Chapter <span class="smcap">xl</span>: Bentley's edition, following the early
editions, reads:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for Henry is in Norfolk; business called him to Everingham
ten days ago, or perhaps he only pretended the call, for the sake of
being travelling at the same time that you were.'</p></div>

<p>Mr. Johnson and the Winchester Edition read 'to call.'
There seems little doubt that 'the call' is the right reading.</p>

<p>8. Chapter <span class="smcap">xlvii</span>: Bentley and nearly all editions
read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Time would undoubtedly abate somewhat of his sufferings, but
still it was a sort of thing which he never could get entirely the better
of; and as to his ever meeting with any other woman who could&mdash;it
was too impossible to be named but with indignation.</p></div>

<p>The broken sentence means 'a woman who could console
him for the loss of Mary.'</p>

<p>Mr. Johnson's editions make nonsense of the passage by
substituting a comma for the dash after 'could.'</p>

<p>9. Chapter <span class="smcap">xlviii</span>: Bentley, following the early editions,
reads:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Maria had destroyed her own character, and he would not, by a
vain attempt to restore what never would be restored, be affording his
sanction to vice, or in seeking to lessen its disgrace, be anywise
accessory to introducing such misery in another man's family, as he
had known himself.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Johnson and the Winchester Edition read 'by affording
his sanction to vice,' which is an unnecessary alteration.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span></p>


<div class='center'><br />'<span class='smcap'>Emma</span>'</div>

<p>1. Chapter <span class="smcap">xviii</span>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'No, Emma; your amiable young man can be amiable only in
French, not in English. He may be very "aimable," have very good
manners, and be very agreeable; but he can have no English delicacy
towards the feelings of other people&mdash;nothing really amiable about
him.'</p></div>

<p>This reading, found in the first edition and the
Winchester Edition, is without doubt correct; but Bentley,
Johnson, and the Hampshire Edition read 'He may be very
"amiable."'</p>

<p>2. Chapter <span class="smcap">xxiii</span>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>But when satisfied on all these points, and their acquaintance
proportionably advanced, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Johnson, in his 1892 edition, did not approve of the
word 'proportionably,' and read '[proportionately]'; but he
has since altered his mind. The first edition and all others
read 'proportionably,' and there appears to be authority for
such a word.</p>

<p>3. Chapter <span class="smcap">xxv</span>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Vanity, extravagance, love of change, restlessness of temper,
which must be doing something, good or bad; heedlessness as to
the pleasure of his father and Mrs. Weston, indifferent as to how
his conduct might appear in general; he became liable to all these
[changes].</p></div>

<p>There are two words in the sentence, which differ in the
various editions. The first edition reads 'indifferent' .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
'changes.' Bentley reads 'indifference' .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 'changes.' Mr.
Johnson and the Winchester Edition read 'indifferent' and
'charges'; the Hampshire Edition 'indifference' and 'charges.'
'Indifference' would seem to be probably right; 'charges,'
certainly right.</p>

<p>4. Chapter <span class="smcap">xxix</span>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Emma,' said she, 'this paper is worse than I expected. Look!
in places you see it is dreadfully dirty: and the wainscot is more
yellow and forlorn than anything could have imagined.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></p>

<p>So the first edition; Bentley, and the Hampshire Edition,
insert 'one'; Mr. Johnson and the Winchester Edition 'I'
after 'anything.'</p></div>

<p>5. Chapter <span class="smcap">xxxii</span>, where Mrs. Elton says to Emma:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, it is very delightful to me
to be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial to as
Maple Grove. I have spent so many happy minutes there!'
(with a little sign of sentiment).</p></div>

<p>So Mr. Johnson's editions read, following the first edition.
But Bentley's, as well as the Hampshire and Winchester
Editions, read 'sigh,' which seems to be certainly right.</p>

<p>6. Chapter <span class="smcap">xliv</span>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Jane took Mrs. Elton aside, and told her at once, that upon
thinking over the advantages of Mrs. Suckling's situation, she had
come to the resolution of accepting it.</p></div>

<p>So the first edition, followed by Bentley; but this is
plainly a mistake for Mrs. Smallridge's, and is corrected by
Mr. Johnson, the Winchester and Hampshire Editions.</p>

<p>7. Chapter <span class="smcap">xlvi</span>, where Mr. Weston tells Emma that his
wife has something to break to her, and Emma at once fears
for her relations in Brunswick Square:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Mrs. Weston, do not trifle with me. Consider how many of my
dearest friends are now in Brunswick Square. Which of them is it?
I charge you by all that is sacred not to attempt concealment.'</p>

<p>'Upon my word, Emma&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Your word! Why not your honour! Why not say upon your
honour, that it has nothing to do with any of them? Good heavens!
What can be to be <i>broke</i> to me that does relate to one of that family?'</p></div>

<p>So the first edition, followed by Bentley. But Mr.
Johnson, the Hampshire and Winchester Editions insert
'not' before 'relate'; and the negative seems needed.</p>

<p>8. Chapter <span class="smcap">xlvii</span>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This was the conclusion of the first series of reflection.</p></div>

<p>So the first edition, followed by Bentley; Mr. Johnson,
the Hampshire and Winchester Editions give 'reflections.'
But in Jane Austen's novels the expression 'a series of'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
is continually followed by a noun in the singular, when
nowadays we should probably use the plural&mdash;e.g. <i>Emma</i>,
chapter xxxvi, 'a series of dissipation'; <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>,
chapter xxvii, 'a series of rain'; chapter xlvi, 'a series of
imprudence.'</p>

<p>Cf. <i>Emma</i>, chapter xxii, 'after a series of what appeared to
him strong encouragement'; though the Hampshire Edition
has altered this to 'encouragements.'</p>


<div class='center'><br />'<span class="smcap">Northanger Abbey</span>'</div>

<p>1. Chapter <span class="smcap">vi</span>: 'I am sure it is Laurentina's skeleton.'
A reference to Mrs. Radcliffe's <i>The Mysteries of Udolpho</i>
will show that 'Laurentina' should be 'Laurentini.' All
editions, however, read 'Laurentina.'</p>

<p>2. Chapter <span class="smcap">viii</span>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Let us walk about and quiz people. Come along with me,
and I will show you the four greatest quizzers in the room; my
two younger sisters and their partners. I have been laughing at
them this half-hour.'</p></div>

<p>So the first edition, the Hampshire and Winchester Editions.
Bentley, however, reads 'quizzes,' which seems correct, as
the word 'quizzer' usually bore an active sense, and 'quiz'
a passive.</p>

<p>3. Chapter <span class="smcap">xi</span>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>They all spent the evening together at Thorpe's.</p></div>

<p>It seems improbable that Jane Austen can have written
anything other than 'at the Thorpes''; but no edition has
had the courage to make the change.</p>

<p>4. Chapter <span class="smcap">xiii</span>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>And with these words she broke away and hurried off. Thorpe
would have darted after her, but Morland withheld him. 'Let her go,
let her go, if she will go. She is as obstinate as&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Thorpe never finished the simile, for it could hardly have been
a proper one.</p></div>

<p>So the first edition reads, followed by Bentley and the
Winchester Edition. The Hampshire Edition boldly gives<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
'Morland,' and this seems the natural solution. The only
alternative is to break up the sentence thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but Morland withheld him. 'Let her go, let her go, if she will.'
'She is as obstinate as&mdash;&mdash;' Thorpe never finished the simile, &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>But this does not seem so natural; nor do we imagine
that the impropriety of the simile would necessarily have
debarred Thorpe from completing it.</p>

<p>5. Chapter <span class="smcap">xxii</span>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>And for his part, to his uncritical palate, the tea was as well
flavoured from the clay of Staffordshire as from that of Dresden or
S&ecirc;ve. But this was quite an old set, purchased two years ago.</p></div>

<p>So the first edition, and the Hampshire and Winchester
Editions; but Bentley emends to 'S&egrave;vres,' which must
surely be correct.</p>

<p>6. Chapter <span class="smcap">xxvi</span>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>By ten o'clock the chaise-and-four conveyed the two from the
abbey, and, after an agreeable drive of almost twenty miles, they
entered Woodston, &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>So all the editions; but is not 'two' a misprint for 'trio'&mdash;i.e.
General Tilney, Eleanor, and Catherine? It is certain
that Eleanor was of the party, for we read a little later: 'His
son and daughter's observations were of a different kind.
They had seldom seen him eat so heartily at any table but
his own'; nor is there anything to show that General Tilney
rode on horseback.</p>

<p>For an example of the use of the word 'trio' by Jane
Austen, see <i>Mansfield Park</i>, chapter xxix: 'They were now
a miserable trio.'</p>


<div class='center'><br />'<span class="smcap">Persuasion</span>'</div>

<p>1. Chapter <span class="smcap">i</span>: The Hampshire and Winchester Editions,
following the first edition, print the opening passage as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Sir Walter Elliot, of Kellynch Hall, in Somersetshire, was a man
who, for his own amusement, never took up any book but the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
Baronetage; where he found occupation for an idle hour and consolation
in a distressed one; there his faculties were roused into
admiration and respect, by contemplating the limited remnant of
the earliest patents; there any unwelcome sensations, arising from
domestic affairs, changed naturally into pity and contempt. As he
turned over the almost endless creations of the last century, and there,
if every other leaf were powerless, he could read his own history
with an interest which never failed: this was the page at which
his favourite volume always opened.</p></div>

<p>This obviously makes no sense as it stands; and to no less
a light than Macaulay belongs the credit of putting it right.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Some of his old friends (says Sir G. O. Trevelyan in his <i>Life of
Macaulay</i><a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>) may remember how he prided himself on a correction of
his own in the first page of <i>Persuasion</i> which he maintained to be
worthy of Bentley, and which undoubtedly fulfils all the conditions
required to establish the credit of an emendation; for, without
the alteration of a word, or even of a letter, it turns into perfectly
intelligible common-sense a passage which has puzzled, or which
ought to have puzzled, two generations of Miss Austen's readers.</p></div>

<p>And in a footnote, Sir George says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A slight change in the punctuation effects all that is required.
According to Macaulay the sentence was intended by its author to
run thus: 'There any unwelcome sensations, arising from domestic
affairs, changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over
the almost endless creations of the last century; and there, if every
other leaf were powerless, he could read his own history with an
interest which never failed. This was the page at which his favourite
volume opened.'</p></div>

<p>Whether or not the emendation would have satisfied Bentley
the critic, it eventually satisfied Bentley the publisher, who
adopted it in his later editions.</p>

<p>2. Chapter <span class="smcap">i</span>, a page or two further on, all editions read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Be it known, then, that Sir Walter, like a good father (having
met with one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable
applications), prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughter's
sake. For one daughter, his eldest, he would really have given
up anything, which he had not been very much tempted to do.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
His two other children were of very inferior value.</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span></p>
<p>This is one more instance of a misplaced apostrophe, for,
as Dr. Verrall pointed out in the <i>Cambridge Observer</i>, what
Jane Austen must have written is 'for his dear daughters'
sake.' Even if the antithesis implied in the next sentence did
not demand this, it is obvious that the correct Sir Walter
would never have allowed himself to state that he remained
single for the sake of one daughter only. Indeed, we have a
proof of this in Chapter <span class="smcap">v</span>, when Elizabeth says: 'And as to
my father, I really should not have thought that he who
has kept himself single so long for our sakes need be suspected
now.'</p>

<p>3. Chapter <span class="smcap">xxii</span>: Bentley, following the first edition,
reads:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>She was earnestly begged to return and dine, and give them all the
rest of the day, but her spirits had been so long exerted that at present
she felt unequal to move and fit only for home, where she might be
sure of being as silent as she chose.</p>

<p>Promising to be with them the whole of the following morning,
therefore, she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk
to Camden Place, &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>The Hampshire and Winchester Editions read 'more,'
and this seems likely to be correct; for those acquainted
with the road to Camden Place will know how inadvisable
it would be for anyone 'unequal to move' to attempt it.</p>

<p>4. Chapter <span class="smcap">xxiii</span>: Nearly all editions read: 'The weather
was unfavourable, and she had grieved over the rain on her
friend's account.'</p>

<p>There was no particular 'friend' in the case, as Anne had
promised to spend her morning with the Musgroves, and it
seems certain we should read 'on her friends' account.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span></p>

all the cheap reprints of the novels, nor all the histories of English
literature, &amp;c., which make mention of Jane Austen, nor the
innumerable magazine articles that have been devoted to her
and her writings. Many of these last, however, will be found
recorded in the bibliographies included in Mr. Goldwin Smith's

arms were placed on the front of Balliol towards Broad Street,
now pulled down. He did not live to see the same arms occupy
a similar place on the new buildings at King's College, Cambridge,
erected when his son Augustus was Provost.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> The Perrots seem to have set great store by their armorial
bearings: at least we are told that two branches of them lived
at Northleigh at the same time in the eighteenth century, hardly
on speaking terms with each other, and that one cause of quarrel
was a difference of opinion as to whether the three 'pears'&mdash;which,
in punning heraldry, formed a part of their coat of arms&mdash;were to
be silver or gold.</p></div>

correspondence&mdash;namely, in a letter to Cassandra, dated
September 1, 1796, where she remarks of her sister's letter: 'I
could die of laughter at it, as they used to say at school'; and in
another, dated May 20, 1813, where she describes a room at a
school as being 'totally unschool-like.'</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_24_24" id="Footnote_24_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> It was no uncommon occurrence for the richer folk to hand
on their newspaper to their neighbours. Thus we find the
Austens, while at Steventon, apparently getting theirs from
Mr. Holder at Ashe (<a href="#Page_148">p. 148</a>); and, later, getting Mr. Pinckard's
paper at Lyme (<a href="#Page_148">p. 148</a>). Much in the same way Sir John
Middleton in <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> would not be denied the
satisfaction of sending the Dashwoods his newspaper every day.</p></div>

Devonshire since the episcopate of their ancestor, Offspring
Blackall, Bishop of Exeter in the time of Queen Anne. Our
Sam Blackall (an uncle of the same name had preceded him
as Fellow of Emmanuel) was great-grandson of the Bishop; he
became Fellow, and was ordained, in 1794; took the living of
North Cadbury in 1812, and lived until 1842. His college record
(which we owe to the courtesy of the Fellows) corresponds very
well with our notices of him. He was evidently a sociable and
lively member of the combination-room. The 'parlour-book'
contains frequent mention of bets made by him on politics and
other subjects, and his own particular pair of bowls still survive.
He was tutor in 1811, when a great fire occurred in the College,
and took his share in appealing for funds with which to rebuild
it, application being chiefly made to those who agreed with the
college politics in Church and State. He seems to have been one
of a large family of brothers; another being John Blackall, of
Balliol College, Oxford, for many years a distinguished Exeter
physician, who did not die until 1860.</p></div>

it seems from what has been said above that the MS. confused
two different men. Certainly Cassandra, in telling the story to
her niece Caroline, did not give her that, or any other, name;
for Caroline speaks of the tale as being&mdash;so far as she knew
it&mdash;'nameless and dateless.' A possible alternative suggestion is
that there were two Blackalls concerned: one being the Sam
Blackall mentioned above, the other Jane Austen's admirer in
the west of England.</p></div>

not appear that the author contemplated a re-purchase at that
time; and the publisher was unwilling to relinquish his rights
on any other terms.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_206_206" id="Footnote_206_206"></a><a href="#FNanchor_206_206"><span class="label">[206]</span></a> Later writers have not even been content to accept the
'publisher in Bath,' but have found a name and habitation for
him. Mr. Peach, in his <i>Historic Houses in Bath</i>, published in 1883
(p. 150 <i>note</i>), says: 'The publisher (who purchased <i>Northanger
Abbey</i>), we believe, was Bull.' Mr. Oscar Fay Adams, writing in
1891 (<i>Story of Jane Austen's Life</i>, p. 93), becomes more definite in
his statement that 'nothing of hers (Jane Austen's) had yet been
published; for although Bull, a publisher in Old Bond Street [sc.
in Bath], had purchased in 1802 [<i>sic</i>] the manuscript of <i>Northanger
Abbey</i> for the sum of ten pounds, it was lying untouched&mdash;and
possibly unread&mdash;among his papers, at the epoch of her leaving
Bath.'
</p><p>
It is true that Mr. Dobson, unable to find the authority for
Bull's name, is a little more guarded, when he amusingly writes,
in 1897:&mdash;
</p><p>
'Even at this distance of time, the genuine devotee of Jane
Austen must be conscious of a futile but irresistible desire to
"feel the bumps" of that B&oelig;otian bookseller of Bath, who, having
bought the manuscript of <i>Northanger Abbey</i> for the base price
of ten pounds, refrained from putting it before the world.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Only two suppositions are possible: one, that Mr. Bull of the
Circulating Library at Bath (if Mr. Bull it were) was constitutionally
insensible to the charms of that master-spell which Mrs.
Slipslop calls "ironing"; the other, that he was an impenitent
and irreclaimable adherent of the author of <i>The Mysteries of
Udolpho</i>.'
</p><p>
Mr. Meehan, in his <i>Famous Houses of Bath and District</i> (1901),
is the most circumstantial of all, writing on p. 197:&mdash;
</p><p>
'Her novel <i>Northanger Abbey</i>, which is full of Bath, was
finished in 1798, and in 1803 she sold the manuscript for ten
pounds to Lewis Bull, a bookseller in the "Lower Walks" (now
"Terrace Walk"). Bull had in 1785 succeeded James Leake,
and he in turn was succeeded by John Upham. Bull was the
founder of the well-known library in Bond Street, London&mdash;for
many years known as Bull's Library.</p></div>

notable people. <i>He</i> had been elected deputy for the <i>noblesse</i> to
the States-General in 1789, and had taken at first the popular
side; but as time went on he became estranged from Mirabeau,
and was among the earliest to emigrate in 1790. For the rest
of his life he was engaged in plotting to restore the Bourbons.
His wife had been the celebrated Madame St. Hubert of the
Paris opera-house, and was the only woman ever known to have
inspired Bonaparte to break forth into verse. Both the Count
and Countess were murdered by their valet at Barnes, July 22,
1812. (<i>Un agent secret sous la R&eacute;volution et l'Empire: Le Comte

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_313_313" id="Footnote_313_313"></a><a href="#FNanchor_313_313"><span class="label">[313]</span></a> After a short mention of <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> and <i>Pride and
Prejudice</i> (in which Sir Walter unkindly suggests that Lizzie
Bennet in refusing Darcy 'does not perceive that she has done
a foolish thing until she accidentally visits a very handsome
seat and grounds belonging to her admirer'), the critic devotes
considerable space, including a long quotation, to <i>Emma</i>. Summing
up, he declares as follows:&mdash;
</p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>'Perhaps the reader may collect, from the preceding specimen,
both the merits and faults of the author. The former consist
much in the force of a narrative, conducted with much neatness
and point, and a quiet yet comic dialogue, in which the characters
of the speakers evolve themselves with dramatic effect. The
faults, on the contrary, arise from the minute detail which the
author's plan comprehends. Characters of folly or simplicity,
such as those of old Woodhouse and Miss Bates, are ridiculous
when first presented, but if too often brought forward or too
long dwelt upon, their prosing is apt to become as tiresome in
fiction as in real society.'</p></div>
<p>
Had not Sir Walter found it necessary to be somewhat apologetic
in commending in public anything so frivolous as a novel,
his praise would probably have been more whole-hearted, as
in the well-known passage in his diary, under date March 14,
1826:&mdash;
</p><div class='blockquot'><p>
'Read again, for the third time at least, Miss Austen's finely
written novel of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>. That young lady has a
talent for describing the involvements and feelings and characters
of ordinary life, which is to me the most wonderful I ever met
with. The big Bow-Wow strain I can do myself like any now
going; but the exquisite touch which renders ordinary commonplace
things and characters interesting from the truth of the
description and the sentiment is denied to me. What a pity
such a gifted creature died so early!'</p></div>
